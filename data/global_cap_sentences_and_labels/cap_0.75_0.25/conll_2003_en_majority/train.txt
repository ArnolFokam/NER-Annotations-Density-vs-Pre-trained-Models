" O

said O

was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
court O

sentence O

Publishing O
and O
distributing O
neo-Nazi O
material O
is O
illegal O
in O

Lauck O

had O
argued O
that O

sporting O
his O

showed O
no O

more O

an O

out O
the O

But O
as O
Lauck B-PER
was O
about O
to O
be O
led O
away O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
reporters O
and O
blurted O
out O
a O
virtually O
incomprehensible O
quick-fire O
diatribe O
against O
the O
court O

" O
Neither O
the O

dared O
to O

in O
an O
oblique O
reference O
to O
his O

from O
Denmark O
. O
" O

That O

the O
truth O

" O

His O
attorney O
, O
Hans-Otto O
Sieg O
, O
told O
reporters O
outside O
the O

that O
the O

had O
not O

how O
a O

court O
could O
judge O
someone O

out O

convicted O

He O
will O
probably O
be O
free O
in O
around O
two O
and O
a O
half O

The O

ruled O
that O

15 O

" O

Many O

now O
that O

was O

that O
has O
sent O

up O
over O
how O

one O
at O
Mont-sur-Marchienne B-LOC

both O

the O
southern O
city O
of O
Charleroi B-LOC
. O

Both O
houses O
are O
owned O
by O
Dutroux O
. O

Belgian O
media O
speculated O
that O
Dutroux B-PER
, O
charged O
with O
abduction O
and O
illegal O
imprisonment O
of O
children O
, O
must O
have O
had O
high O

They O
put O
forward O
no O
proof O
to O
support O
the O
speculation O
, O
but O
seized O
on O
a O
comment O
by O
chief O
prosecutor O
Michel O
Bourlet B-PER
on O
Belgian O
television O
on O
Friday O
night O
that O
he O
would O
chase O
down O
everyone O
involved O
in O
the O
case O
" O
if O
I O
am O
allowed O
to O
" O
. O

Dutroux B-PER
was O
charged O
a O
week O

after O
police O
rescued O
two O
young O
girls O
from O
a O
concrete O
dungeon O
in O
the O
basement O
of O
one O
of O
the O
six O

owns O
in O

around O
Charleroi O
. O

Just O
a O
day O
later O
the O
national O
euphoria O
at O
the O
rescue O
turned O
to O
disgust O
as O
Dutroux O
led O
police O
to O
the O
bodies O
of O
two O
eight-year-old O
girls O
in O
another O
of O
his O
houses O
. O

Julie O
Lejeune O

Russo I-PER
, O
had O
been O
kidnapped O
in O
June O
last O
year O
. O

The O
fate O
of O
the O
girls O
is O
unknown O
, O
but O
there O
has O
been O
speculation O
they O
were O
sold O
into O
prostitution O
in O
Slovakia O
or O
the O
Czech O
Republic O
where O
Dutroux O
was O
a O

visitor O

second O
wife O

charged O
as O
an O

The O
others O
have O
been O
charged O
with O
abduction O
and O
illegal O
imprisonment O
of O
children O
or O
are O
suspected O
of O
criminal O
association O

Among O
the O
revelations O
are O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
gendarmerie O
was O
running O
a O
surveillance O
operation O
codenamed O
" O
Othello O
" O
against O
Dutroux B-PER
in O
1995 O
-- O
when O
both O
Julie O
and O
Melissa O
and O
An O
and O
Eefje B-PER
were O
kidnapped O
. O

They O
show O
that O
the O
gendarmes O
were O
aware O
that O
Dutroux O
was O
building O
cells O
in O
some O
of O
his O
houses O
for O
holding O
children O
, O
yet O
this O
information O
was O
either O
not O
passed O
on O
to O
other O
police O
forces O
searching O
for O
the O
missing O
girls O
or O
was O
overlooked O
when O
it O
was O
. O

They O
also O
show O
that O
police O
investigating O
a O
theft O
visited O
Dutroux B-PER
late O
last O
year O
at O
the O
house O
where O
Julie O
and O
Melissa O
were O
being O
held O
but O
accepted O
his O
word O
that O
the O
children O
's O
cries O
they O
could O
hear O
came O
from O
neighbours O
. O

There O
is O
also O
widespread O
disbelief O
that O
no O
one O
appeared O
to O
question O
how O
Dutroux B-PER
, O
an O
unemployed O
father O
of O
three O
with O
no O

LONDON O
1996-08-25 O

Chris O
Lewis O
did O
his O
best O
to O
forget O
his O
controversial O
omission O
from O
the O
England B-LOC
one-day O
squad O
on O
Sunday O
but O
could O
not O
prevent O
Pakistan O
reasserting O
their O
dominance O
in O
the O
final O
test O
at O
The O
Oval O
. O

A O
super O
piece O
of O
fielding O
by O
Lewis O
, O
dropped O
as O
a O
disciplinary O
measure O
after O
arriving O
only O
35 O
minutes O
before O
the O
start O
on O
the O
fourth O
morning O
, O
provided O
the O
only O
bright O
spot O
for O
England B-LOC
as O
the O
touring O
team O
batted O
on O
to O
reach O
413 O
for O
five O
at O
the O
interval O
, O
a O
lead O
of O
87 O
. O

The O
solitary O
wicket O
to O
fall O
was O
Asif O
Mujtaba O
, O
run O
out O
for O
13 O
attempting O
a O
second O
run O
to O
third O
man O
where O
Lewis O
was O
lurking O
with O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O

There O
seemed O
scant O
danger O
until O
the O
Surrey O
player O
swooped O
on O
to O
the O
ball O
and O
returned O
off O
balance O
to O
county O
team O
mate O
Alec O
Stewart O
who O
whipped O
off O
the O
bails O
. O

Lewis O
, O
though O
, O
could O
not O
make O
similar O
waves O
with O
the O
ball O
as O
Salim O
Malik O
and O
Wasim B-PER
Akram I-PER
batted O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
session O
with O
few O
alarms O
. O

Wasim B-PER
rattled O
along O
to O
30 O
not O
out O
, O
outscoring O
his O
partner O
who O
was O
unbeaten O
on O
24 O
at O
the O
break O
, O
although O
the O
weather O
was O
again O
threatening O
to O
play O
the O
dominant O
role O
. O

The O
weather O
delayed O
the O

the O

what O

been O
as O
the O
emotions O

I O
was O
right O
here O
, O
' O
' O
he O
said O
standing O
at O
the O
spot O
where O
he O
had O
received O
the O
ball O
for O
the O
kick O
. O

The O
maul O
was O
there O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
go O
in O
but O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
hold O
off O
because O
we O
had O
the O
ball O
. O

When O
( O
halfback O
) O
Justin O
Marshall O
got O
the O
ball O
he O
was O
going O
to O
go O
on O
the O
openside O
where O
Jon O
Preston O
was O
so O
I O
emptied O
my O
lung O
at O
him O
to O
get O
the O
ball O
this O
way O
. O

I O
just O
hit O
through O
and O
I O
was O
punching O
the O
air O
before O
the O
ball O
got O
there O
. O

The O
decision O
to O
attempt O
a O
dropped O
goal O
was O
a O
spontaneous O
one O
, O
Brooke B-PER
said O
. O

It O
was O
just O
like O
the O
World O
Cup O
, O
the O
ball O
came O
and O
the O
chance O
was O
there O
. O

' O

Centre O
Frank O
Bunce O
said O
he O
had O
never O
felt O
so O
exhausted O
during O
a O
match O
. O

We O
were O
gutted O
and O
there O
was O
nowhere O
to O
hide O
, O
they O
just O
kept O
coming O
at O
you O
, O
' O
' O
he O
said O
. O

I O
was O
gone O
in O
the O
first O
20 O
minutes O
, O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
but O
you O
had O
no O
choice O
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
just O
how O
big O
this O
ground O
was O
yesterday O
. O

' O

Two-try O
winger O
Jeff O
Wilson B-PER
said O
he O
was O
so O
tired O
that O
he O
kept O
asking O
Bunce B-PER
where O
he O
should O
be O
while O
defending O
. O

He O
told O
me O
I O
'm O
buggered O
too O
so O
just O
hang O
in O
there O

Commission O
last O

to O
paint O
the O
broad O

National O

mistakes O
they O
had O
made O
and O
accepted O
broad O
responsibility O
for O
the O
actions O
of O
their O
foot O

. O

But O
none O
named O

or O
carrying O
out O
any O
of O
the O
gross O
violations O
of O

But O
Currin O

who O

this O
was O
not O
the O

the O
commission O

aims O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

He O
cited O
Coetzee O

who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O

interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O

His O
trial O
is O
due O

start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin O
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O

all O

prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O

But O
Gilbertson O

the O

From O

perspective O
we O
are O
taking O
the O
position O
that O
it O
is O
not O
on O
, O
" O
Gilbertson O
said O
. O

Looking O
ahead O
to O
the O
current O
financial O

, O
he O
said O
that O
Gencor B-ORG
would O
boost O

further O
. O

" O
Gencor B-ORG
is O
well O
placed O
to O
take O
up O
the O
challenges O
of O
the O
future O
. O

The O
group O
is O
soundly O
structured O
and O
prudently O
financed O
and O
is O
blessed O
with O
an O
excellent O

I O
think O
we O
can O
look O
forward O
to O

. O

" O
We O
've O
tried O
to O
clean O
up O
our O

by O
disposing O
of O

The O
biggest O
of O
those O
was O

Gilbertson O

. O

Referring O
to O
Gencor O
's O
increased O
41.5 O

stake O
in O
Ingwe B-ORG
, O
Gilbertson O
said O
the O
group O
would O
wait O
for O
coal O
shares O
to O
be O
cheaper O
before O
considering O
snapping O
up O
more O
. O

" O
I O
think O
we O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
more O
of O
Ingwe O
but O
it O
's O
the O
question O
of O
adding O
value O

at O
quite O
a O

lower O
than O
the O
price O
is O
now O

maybe O
if O
we O
just O
wait O
another O

the O
U.S. O

in O
protest O
over O
the O
men O

but O
the O
former O

was O

out O

" O
I O
still O

what O
happened O

I O
was O
about O

pull O
out O
yesterday O
and O
say O

' O
That O
's O
it O

" O
said O
Stich O
, O
one O
of O
a O
host O
of O
men O
who O
cried O
foul O
over O
seeding O
procedures O
that O
forced O
an O
unprecedented O
remaking O
of O
the O
men O
's O
draw O
last O
week O
. O

" O
But O
there O
are O
so O
many O
reasons O
to O
play O
, O
especially O
spectators O
and O
the O
kids O
who O
come O
out O
here O
and O
want O
to O
enjoy O
watching O
tennis O
, O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
stay O

" O

One O
prominent O
player O
that O
did O
not O
stay O
for O
the O
Open O
was O
French O
Open O
champion O
Yvegeny O
Kafelnikov O
, O
who O
after O
being O
dropped O
three O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B-ORG
ranking O
to O
a O
seventh O
seeding O
, O
withdrew O
and O
returned O
home O
to O
Russia O
. O

Kafelnikov O
had O
pulled O
out O
of O
last O
week O

tournament O
with O
a O
rib O
injury O
. O

At O
a O
news O

by O
approximately O
50 O
players O
on O
Sunday O
, O
U.S. B-LOC
Davis O
Cup O
player O
Todd B-PER
Martin I-PER
expressed O
the O
players O
' O
outrage O
at O
the O
seedings O
. O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O
Open O
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O
our O
sport O
, O
" O
Martin O
said O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich O
. O
" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O

" O

But O
once O
the O

got O
on O

focused O
his O

. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich B-PER
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. O
Open O
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American O
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open O
final O
to O
Andre O
Agassi O
. O

It O
was O
Agassi B-PER
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi O
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich O
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi B-PER
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French O
Open O
and O
Wimbledon O
. O

Stich B-PER
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov B-PER
withdrew O
. O

But O
Stich O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O
the O
top O
16 O
deserves O
to O
be O

, O
Lebed B-PER
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O
, O
somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow O
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya O
remain O
part O
of O
Russia O
, O
will O
be O
no O
easy O
matter O
. O

A O
chain-smoking O
former O
paratroop O
general O
with O
a O
sharp O
line O
in O
deadpan O
putdowns O
and O
a O
soldier O
's O
knack O
for O
making O
life O
sound O
simple O
, O
Lebed O
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O
region O
last O
week O
, O
days O
after O
the O
Russian O
army O
threatened O
to O
bomb O
its O
way O
back O
into O
the O
rebel-held O
Chechen O
capital O
Grozny O
. O

He O
returned O
at O
the O
weekend O
, O
pledging O
to O
conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O
where O
all O
others O
have O
failed O
. O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O

Saying O
he O
needed O
to O
tidy O
up O
legal O
loose O
ends O
on O
the O
deal O
-- O
and O
also O
cover O
his O
back O
against O
unnamed O
pro-war O
schemers O
in O
Moscow O
-- O
he O
flew O
back O
to O
the O
capital O
empty-handed O
on O
Sunday O
. O

He O
met O
Russian O
Prime O
Minister O
Viktor O
Chernomyrdin O
on O
Monday O
and O
, O
according O
to O
the O
press O
service O
of O
Lebed O
's O
Security B-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
could O
meet O
Yeltsin O
on O
Tuesday O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O
of O
Yeltsin B-PER
's O
holiday O
, O
announced O
later O
, O
would O
affect O
plans O
to O
talk O
. O

Moscow O
's O
as O
yet O
undisclosed O
proposals O
on O
Chechnya B-LOC

political O
future O
have O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
been O
sent O
back O
to O
do O
the O
rounds O
of O
various O
government O
departments O
. O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O
plan O
. O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed O
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya O
as O
Yeltsin O
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed O
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov I-PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin O
. O

Lebed O
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov B-PER
warned O
that O
Lebed O
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens O
say O
-- O
Russian O
forces O
. O

Maskhadov O
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed O
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B-LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

Chernomyrdin O
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya O
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Federation I-LOC
-- O
something O
Moscow O
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-LOC
Caucasus I-LOC
. O

Lebed O
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O
. O

Despite O

, O
analysts O
were O
convinced O
that O

" O

" O
At O
the O

it O

" O
Erdei O
added O

" O
Cofinec O
is O
a O
very O
good O
story O
in O
the O
long-term O
as O
the O

still O

a O
very O
strong O

be O
expected O

, O
" O
Sitanyi O
said O
, O
saying O
that O
several O

WASHINGTON O
1996-08-28 O

The O
Securities O
and O
Exchange O
Commission O
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq O
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

The O
SEC O
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O
SEC O
's O
division O
of O
market O
regulation O
, O
Richard B-PER
Lindsey I-PER
, O
said O
Wall O
Street O
firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC O
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O
month O
, O
the O
SEC O
settled O
charges O
of O
alleged O
malpractices O
on O
Nasdaq O
when O
the O
parent O
of O
the O
Nasdaq O
market O
, O
the O
National O
Association O
of O
Securities O
Dealers O
, O
agreed O
to O
spend O
$ O
100 O
million O
over O
five O
years O
to O
upgrade O
its O
oversight O
of O
brokers O
' O
trading O
practices O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O

before O
considering O
the O

Outspoken O
Andrei O
Medvedev O
exchanged O
his O
reputation O
as O
the O
clown O
prince O
of O
tennis O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
a O
new O
no-nonsense O
attitude O
that O
has O
made O
life O
on O
the O
courts O
fun O
again O
. O

" O
I O
think O
I O
'm O
much O
more O
focused O
on O
what O
I O
have O
to O
do O
, O
and O
that O
's O
playing O
tennis O
, O
" O
Medvedev O
said O
after O
routing O
Frenchman O
Jean-Philippe O
Fleurian O
6-2 O
6-0 O
6-1 O
in O
the O
opening O
round O
of O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
. O

It O
was O
Medvedev O
's O
sixth O
victory O
in O
a O
row O
after O
winning O
his O
first O
tournament O
of O
the O
year O
last O
week O
at O
the O
Hamlet O
Cup O
. O

" O
I O
realised O
this O
year O
, O
that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev O
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O
tennis O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O
before O
, O
they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O
helping O
me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

For O
Medvedev O
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O
issues O
such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O
food O
in O
the O
players O
lounge O
, O
an O
entertaining O
rant O
that O
took O
his O
mind O
off O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
. O

" O
I O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
here O
for O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev O
, O
who O
lost O
in O
the O
second O
round O
of O
the O
Open O
the O
last O
two O
years O
after O
reaching O
the O
quarters O
in O
1993 O
, O
the O
same O
year O
he O
tried O
his O
hand O
as O
a O
restaurant O
critic O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
not O
here O
to O
fight O
the O
press O
or O
talk O
about O
the O
food O
or O
entertain O
the O
people O
off O
the O
court O
. O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O
the O
court O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

But O
Medvedev O
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian O
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O
months O
ago O
. O

" O
It O
's O
somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev O
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev O
hired O
Australian O
coach O
Bob O
Brett O
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O
pay O
off O
. O

While O
Medvedev O
's O
77-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian B-PER
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
were O
playing O
each O
other O
was O
rather O
remarkable O
. O

In O
the O
original O
draw O
, O
Medvedev O
and O
Fleurian O
were O
slotted O
to O
play O
each O
other O
. O

When O
controversy O
forced O
the O
draw O
to O
be O
done O
over O
-- O
against O
odds O
of O
151-to-1 O
-- O
Medvedev O
and O
Fleurian O
drew O
each O
other O
a O
second O
time O
. O

I O
think O
it O

destined O
that O
it O
turned O
out O
for O
me O

The O
European O
Commission O
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain B-LOC
's O
mad O
cow O
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
2001 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would O
change O
an O
agreed O
slaughter O
campaign O
. O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU O
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission O
spokesman O
Gerard B-PER
Kiely O
told O

. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O

, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain O
and O
its O
14 O
EU O
partners O
. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE O
cases O
possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European O
Commission O
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE O
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely O
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O

to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O

' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature O
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

British O
farmers O
' O
leader O
called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe O
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish O
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain B-LOC
and O
the O
EU O
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O
ban O
on O
British O
beef O
after O
the O

said O
there O
could O
be O
a O
link O
between O
BSE O
and O
the O
human O

of O
the O

. O

The O
issue O
flared O
in O

: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O

is O
the O

has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O

it O

equally O
we O

certainly O
not O

" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope O
said O
the O

was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O

pressed O

had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O

. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O

and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O

actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O

Speculation O
that O
Rubin O
might O
not O
stay O
in O
his O
post O
grew O
after O
he O
sidestepped O
questions O
about O
any O
future O
Cabinet O
post O
during O
television O
interviews O
at O
the O
Democratic O
convention O
in O
Chicago O
this O
week O
. O

Should O
Rubin B-PER
leave O
, O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O
policy O
with O
him O
. O

" O
Obviously O
, O
under O
the O
Clinton O
administration O
, O
we O
've O
seen O
two O
distinctively O
different O
dollar O
policies O
, O
" O
said O
Chris O
Widness O
, O
an O
international O
economist O
at O
Chase O
Securities O
Inc. O
" O
Under O
Rubin O
, O
the O
U.S. O
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O
dollar O
. O
" O

That O
strategy O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
timely O
instances O
of O
joint O
central O
bank O
intervention O
, O
helped O
the O
dollar O
battle O
back O
from O
post-Second O
World O
War O
lows O
of O
1.3438 O
German O
marks O
on O

and O
79.75 O
Japanese O
yen O
on O
April O
19 O
, O
1995 O
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
dollar O
stands O
at O
about O
1.48 O
marks O
and O
109 O
yen O
. O

Rubin O
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
26 O
years O
on O
Wall O
Street O
, O
part O
of O
which O
were O
spent O
as O
co-chairman O
of O
Goldman B-ORG
, I-ORG
Sachs I-ORG
and I-ORG
Co I-ORG

Inc B-ORG
. O

" O
Rubin O
has O
done O
a O
fine O
job O
in O
that O
position O
, O
" O
said O
Michael O
Faust O
, O
a O
portfolio O
manager O
at O
Bailard O
, O
Biehl O
and O
Kaiser O
, O
which O
manages O
just O
under O
$ O
1 O
billion O
in O
global O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
. O

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O
fill O
. O
" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury O
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era O
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
financial O
markets O
. O

Some O
overseas O
investors O
might O
shy O
away O
from O
buying O
U.S. O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
or O
even O
sell O
them O
when O
the O
dollar O
is O
weakening O
. O

As O
for O
U.S. O
Treasury O
securities O
, O
Widness O
explained O
that O
Alan O
Greenspan O
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve I-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin O
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury O
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United O
States O
, O
" O
said O
Widness O
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. O
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin O
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

" O
If O
he O
left O
, O
the O
first O
question O
people O
would O
ask O
the O
next O
guy O
is O
, O
' O
What O
's O
your O
view O
on O
the O

" O
And O
all O
I O
can O
say O
as O
a O
piece O
of O
advice O
is O
that O
they O
'd O
better O
