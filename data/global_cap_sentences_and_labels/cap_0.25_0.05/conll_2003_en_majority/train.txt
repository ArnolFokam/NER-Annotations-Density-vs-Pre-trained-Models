Human O

lawyer O
Brian O
Currin O
said O
the O
hearings O
last O

were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O
form O
of O
confessional O
and O
that O
those O
who O

would O
testify O
only O

of O
the O

the O

some O

His O
trial O

the O

intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin O
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O
approached O
the O

Boraine O
said O
the O
