Lauck O

against O

that O
his O

have O
been O
set O
free O
because O
he O
had O
not O
committed O
any O
offence O
under O
German O
law O

The O
German O
government O
hailed O
the O
conviction O
as O
a O
major O
victory O
in O
the O
fight O
against O

said O
Bertram O

also O
read O
out O
extracts O
from O
Lauck O

material O
praising O
Hitler O
as O
" O
the O
greatest O
of O
all O
leaders O
" O
and O
describing O
the O
Nazi O
slaughter O
of O
millions O
of O
Jews O
as O
a O
myth O
. O

He O
had O
demanded O
a O
five-year O
jail O

said O
he O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
court O

sentence O

in O

he O
" O

sporting O
his O

showed O
no O

more O

an O

reading O
out O
the O
verdict O

the O

decision O

But O
as O
Lauck O
was O
about O
to O
be O
led O
away O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
reporters O
and O
blurted O
out O
a O
virtually O
incomprehensible O
quick-fire O
diatribe O
against O
the O
court O
. O

" O
Neither O
the O
National O
Socialists O
( O
Nazis O

nor O
the O
communists O
dared O
to O
kidnap O

to O
his O
extradition O

from O

" O

His O
attorney O
, O
Hans-Otto O

told O

how O
a O
German O

could O
judge O
someone O
for O
actions O
carried O
out O
in O
the O
United O

The O
court O
rejected O
Sieg O
's O
argument O
that O
Lauck O
's O
extradition O
from O
Denmark O
, O
where O
he O
was O
arrested O
in O

convicted O
of O

organisations O
. O

He O
will O
probably O
be O
free O
in O
around O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

The O
court O
ruled O
that O
the O
15 O
months O
he O
has O
spent O
in O
custody O
since O
his O
arrest O
should O
be O
subtracted O
from O

bringing O
hope O

to O
millions O

with O

" O
The O

must O
know O
that O
we O
love O

" O

While O
the O

heaps O

her O
and O

regards O
her O
as O
a O

not O

When O
in O

she O

she O
said O
characteristically O
: O
" O
I O

In O

Clinton O
signed O
into O

an O
increase O
in O

a O

that O
makes O
it O
easier O
for O

with O
a O

" O

According O

" O

Just O
a O

the O

Dutroux O
led O

to O
the O

two O
eight-year-old O

The O
fate O
of O
the O

there O
has O
been O
speculation O

were O
sold O

the O
speculation O
in O
the O
Belgian O

of O
high-level O
protection O

a O
high O
degree O
of O

bungling O

They O
show O
that O
the O

were O
aware O
that O
Dutroux O
was O
building O
cells O
in O
some O
of O
his O
houses O
for O

, O
the O

The O
decline O
is O
all O
the O
worse O
for O
people O
who O
recall O
wasteful O
Soviet O
times O
, O
when O
the O
Kremlin O
imported O
grain O
but O
priced O
bread O
so O
cheaply O
that O
people O
bought O
it O
to O
feed O
their O

. O

Borsuk O
said O
the O
farm O
sector O
has O
two O
options O
: O
" O
We O
can O
sit O
down O

cry O
, O
or O
we O
can O
do O
something O

Further O
plans O

The O

has O
been O
trying O
to O
phase O
out O

subsidies O
to O
the O
farm O

in O
a O
move O
back O

Collective O

It O
could O
be O
a O
sobering O
experience O
for O
the O
Kremlin O

who O
, O
just O
two O
months O
after O
being O
appointed O
by O
the O

two O
heady O
weeks O
after O
taking O

wrap O

mood O

compromise O
in O
the O

after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O

may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O

somewhere O

He O
returned O
at O

a O

settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O

all O

, O
could O
meet O

It O

mounted O

Yeltsin O

hardly O
seen O

his O

kept O
out O

then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

Maskhadov O
warned O
that O
Lebed O
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O

the O

involving O

may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O

gap O

sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O

" O
The O
first O
half O
of O
the O
year O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
as O
strong O
as O
expected O
so O
the O

probably O
be O
unable O
to O
reach O

" O

Both O

were O
convinced O

" O

, O
some O
20 O

to O

over O
his O

a O

After O

, O
Lebed O

said O
he O
might O
meet O

But O
Yeltsin O

rebuffed O
the O
suggestion O
, O
saying O
the O
president O
had O
left O
Moscow O
for O
a O
holiday O
near O
the O
capital O
. O

The O
Russians O
postponed O
the O

" O
I O
realised O
this O

that O
without O

99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O

, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O
before O
, O
they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O

me O
at O
all O

" O

For O
Medvedev O
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O
issues O
such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O
food O
in O
the O
players O
lounge O
, O
an O
entertaining O
rant O
that O
took O
his O
mind O
off O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
. O

I O
'm O
here O
to O
play O
tennis O
and O
to O
win O

I O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O
the O

, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev O
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French O
Open O
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev O
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian O
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O
months O
ago O
. O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev O
hired O
Australian O
coach O
Bob O
Brett O
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O
pay O
off O
. O

Winning O
in O
Long O
Island O
( O
last O
week O
) O
was O
like O
winning O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
" O

While O
Medvedev O
's O
77-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian O
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
were O
playing O
each O
other O
was O
rather O
remarkable O
. O

In O
the O
original O
draw O
, O
Medvedev O
and O
Fleurian O
were O
slotted O
to O
play O
each O
other O
. O

When O
controversy O
forced O
the O
draw O
to O
be O
done O
over O
-- O
against O
odds O
of O
151-to-1 O
-- O
Medvedev O
and O
Fleurian O
drew O
each O

a O

" O
When O

Dole O

three O

that O

neither O

an O

Under O

Lloyd O

plans O
to O

its O
massive O

into O
a O

" O
said O
Colorado O
attorney O

Gale O

Norton O
said O
she O
was O
concerned O
that O
the O
Lloyd O

immunizes O
it O

requires O
that O
all O

seeks O

That O
case O
" O
is O
what O
I O
call O
the O
most O
significant O
alternate O
remedy O
for O
us O
, O
" O
Chiate O
said O
. O

The O
individual O
Names O

" O

Rejection O
involved O
forfeiting O

" O
Demel O
told O

Looking O
at O

, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O

probably O

the O

he O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O

He O
described O
the O
condition O
of O
the O

" O
. O

Because O
of O

we O
introduced O
certain O

they O
are O
not O
draconian O
measures O

we O
brought O
it O
down O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall O
Street O
this O
week O
as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O
Robert O
Rubin O
might O
forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury O
secretary O
if O
President O
Clinton O
is O
re-elected O
. O

Speculation O
that O
Rubin O
might O
not O
stay O
in O
his O
post O
grew O
after O
he O
sidestepped O
questions O
about O
any O
future O
Cabinet O
post O
during O
television O
interviews O
at O
the O
Democratic O
convention O
in O
Chicago O
this O
week O
. O

Should O
Rubin O
leave O
, O
Wall O
Street O
would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O
policy O
with O
him O
. O

Rubin O
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
26 O
years O
on O
Wall O
Street O
, O
part O
of O
which O
were O
spent O
as O
co-chairman O
of O
Goldman B-ORG
, I-ORG
Sachs I-ORG
and I-ORG

" O
Rubin O
has O
done O
a O
fine O
job O
in O
that O
position O
, O
" O
said O
Michael O
Faust O
, O
a O
portfolio O
manager O
at O
Bailard O
, O
Biehl O
and O
Kaiser O
, O
which O
manages O
just O
under O
$ O
1 O
billion O
in O
global O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
. O

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O
fill O
. O
" O

Some O
overseas O
investors O
might O
shy O
away O
from O
buying O
U.S. O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
or O
even O
sell O
them O
when O
the O
dollar O
is O
weakening O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin O
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury O
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin O
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White O
House O
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
currency O

" O
And O
all O

a O
piece O
of O
advice O
is O
that O
they O
'd O
better O
say O
exactly O
the O
same O
thing O
