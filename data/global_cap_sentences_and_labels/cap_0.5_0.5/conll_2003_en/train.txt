his O
controversial O
omission O

A O
super O

dropped O
as O
a O
disciplinary O
measure O
after O
arriving O
only O
35 O
minutes O
before O
the O

on O
the O

only O

as O
the O

on O
to O
reach O
413 O
for O
five O
at O
the O
interval O
, O
a O
lead O
of O
87 O

The O
solitary O
wicket O

was O
Asif O
Mujtaba O
, O
run O
out O
for O
13 O
attempting O
a O
second O
run O
to O
third O
man O
where O
Lewis O
was O
lurking O
with O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O

There O
seemed O
scant O
danger O
until O
the O
Surrey B-ORG

swooped O
on O
to O
the O
ball O
and O
returned O
off O
balance O
to O
county O

Alec B-PER
Stewart I-PER

whipped O
off O
the O

Wasim O

" O

Thousands O

denounced O
Bosnia B-LOC

elections O
as O
a O
farce O
on O
Sunday O
because O
Serb O
incomers O
would O
be O
able O
to O
vote O
in O
their O
old O
home O
town O
, O
cementing O
partition O

the O
country O
. O

They O
said O
they O
were O
ready O
to O
force O
their O
way O
back O
across O
post-war O
ethnic O
lines O
to O
Serb-held O
Doboj O
, O
one O
of O
several O
towns O
where O
NATO O
troops O
fear O
violence O
involving O
refugees O
determined O
to O
vote O
where O
they O
once O
lived O
. O

We O
demand O
to O
vote O
in O
Doboj B-LOC
, O
" O
other O
banners O
said O
. O

Bosnia O
's O
Moslem-led O
central O
government O
and O
many O
displaced O
Moslems O
are O
angered O
by O
a O
key O
provision O
of O
the O
Western-organised O
September O
14 O
elections O
allowing O
people O
to O
vote O
in O
post-war O
" O
new O
places O
of O
residence O
. O
" O

As O
a O
result O
, O
separatist O
Serb O
authorities O
have O
packed O
former O
Moslem O
majority O
towns O
with O
refugees O
of O
their O
own O
or O
registered O
other O
Serbs O
to O
vote O
there O
. O

Critics O
say O
that O
what O
was O
billed O
as O
an O
electoral O
process O
to O
reintegrate O
Bosnia B-LOC
as O
a O
single O
, O
multi-ethnic O
state O
is O
shaping O
up O
as O
a O
referendum O
on O
partition O
, O
de O
facto O
or O
de O
jure O
. O

How O
can O
we O
then O
expect O
the O
reintegration O
of O
Bosnia B-LOC
? O

But O
no O
one O
will O
stop O
us O
from O
returning O
to O
our O
homes O
. O

Mirhunisa O
Komarica O
, O
a O

official O
, O
said O
: O
" O
We O
want O
to O
vote O
where O
we O
were O
thrown O
out O
from O
. O

Bosnian O
Vice O
President O
Ejup O
Ganic O
, O
a O
Moslem O
, O
told O
the O
refugees O
: O
" O
We O
have O
a O
message O
for O
the O
Serbs O
who O
are O
now O
in O
our O
homes O
not O

plan O
the O
future O
of O

children O
there O
because O
there O
will O
be O
no O
good O
fortune O
in O
that O
. O
" O

To O
loud O
applause O
, O
he O
added O
: O
" O
We O
will O
enter O
Doboj O
, O
untie O
the O
Doboj B-LOC
knot O
and O
ensure O

from O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich B-PER

mind O
that O

did O
tamper O
with O
the O

process O
in O

to O
benefit O

I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O

done O
here O
for O

they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O

the O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU O
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission B-ORG
spokesman O
Gerard O
Kiely O
told O
Reuters B-ORG
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O
cattle O
, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain B-LOC
and O
its O
14 O
EU B-ORG
partners O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE O
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely B-PER
said O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature O
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

British O
farmers O
' O
leader O
called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

Naish B-PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European O
partners O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain O
and O
the O
EU O
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O
ban O
on O
British O
beef O
after O
the O
government O
said O
there O
could O
be O
a O
link O
between O
BSE O

the O
human O
form O

the O

Under O
