explained O
that O
Alan B-PER

reappointment O

the O

the O

whether O

" O
Although O

if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O

seen O

looking O

it O
would O
probably O
hurt O

United B-LOC

said O

adding O
that O
could O
hurt O

, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O

. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B-PER
in O
convincing O

that O
