The O
European B-ORG

it O
disagreed O

shun O
British O
lamb O
until O

" O
We O
do O

support O
any O

we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O
, O
" O
the O
Commission B-ORG
's O
chief O
spokesman O
Nikolaus B-PER
van I-PER
der I-PER
Pas I-PER
told O
a O
news O
briefing O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O
EU O
Farm O

Franz B-PER
Fischler I-PER
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O

animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B-PER
proposed O
EU-wide O
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B-LOC
and O
France B-LOC
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine O
Spongiform O

) O
-- O
mad O
cow O
disease O
. O

But O
Fischler B-PER
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU O
's O
standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O
action O
was O
justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O

health O
. O

" O
The O
cost O

the O

A O

Up O
to O
100,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
held O
in O
Shanghai B-LOC
bonded O
warehouses O
, O
confounding O
the O
world O
market O
as O
to O
its O
source O
and O
ultimate O
fate O
, O
probably O
belongs O
to O
China B-LOC
's O
strategic O
state O

, O
industry O
sources O
said O
on O
Friday O
. O

Around O
40,000 O
tonnes O
of O
the O
copper O
have O
already O
been O
moved O
to O
warehouses O
near O
the O
northern O
port O
of O
Yingkou B-LOC
, O
where O
some O
of O
the O
strategic O
stockpile O
was O
stored O
, O
they O
said O
. O

Just O
who O
owns O
the O
copper O
is O
a O
question O
that O
has O
kept O
traders O
and O
industry O
analysts O
guessing O
since O
the O
metal O
was O
channelled O
into O
Shanghai B-LOC
by O
the O
China B-ORG
National I-ORG
Nonferrous I-ORG
Metals I-ORG
Import I-ORG
and I-ORG
Export I-ORG
Corp I-ORG
( O
CNIEC B-ORG
) O
in O
June O
and O
July O
. O

It O
was O
unclear O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
40,000 O
tonnes O
had O
cleared O
customs O
-- O
which O
would O
provide O
some O
concrete O
indication O
that O
the O
strategic O
reserve O
, O
administered O
directly O
by O
the O
central O
government O
's O
State B-ORG
Planning I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
, O
owned O
the O
copper O
. O

Traders O
have O
said O
the O
reserve O
could O
negotiate O
concessions O
on O
duties O
-- O
three O
percent O
import O
tax O
and O
17 O
percent O
value-added O
tax O
-- O
that O
made O
the O
copper O
prohibitively O
expensive O
otherwise O
. O

But O
one O
source O
, O
the O
head O
of O
a O
Hong O
Kong O
trading O
house O
, O
said O
it O
made O
no O
difference O
if O
the O
copper O
was O
customs O
cleared O
or O
not O
. O

" O
If O
they O
spend O
all O
this O
money O
moving O
the O
copper O
to O
Yingkou B-LOC
, O
it O
will O
be O
sitting O
there O
for O
years O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Once O
it O
arrives O
in O
Yingkou B-LOC
, O
it O
is O
subject O
to O
monitoring O
by O
the O
State O
Planning O
Commission O
, O
which O
has O
to O
give O
permission O
for O
any O
more O
movement O
; O
it O
is O
out O
of O
the O
hands O
of O
traders O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Mystery O
has O
surrounded O
the O
Shanghai B-LOC
stockpile O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
with O
traders O
unsure O
not O
only O
of O
who O
owns O
it O
, O
but O
of O
its O
exact O
size O
and O
what O
its O
owner O
planned O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Trading O
sources O
generally O
agreed O
it O
would O
be O
cost-effective O
to O
take O
the O
copper O
back O
into O
a O
depleted O
central O
reserve O
as O
it O
had O
already O
served O
its O
purpose O
in O
taking O
advantage O
of O
long-term O
backwardation O
on O
the O
London O
Metal O
Exchange O
( O
LME O
) O
. O

A O
backwardation O
occurs O
when O
the O
spot O
price O
of O
a O
metal O
is O
higher O
than O
the O
forward O
price O
. O

CNIEC B-ORG
lent O
around O
85,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
onto O
the O
LME B-ORG
between O
April O
and O
June O
1995 O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
state O
reserve O
, O
running O
the O
state O
stockpile O
down O
to O
115,000 O
tonnes O
from O
200,000 O
tonnes O
previously O
. O

Word O
that O
CNIEC B-ORG
had O
offered O
the O
copper O
to O
European O
trading O
houses O
in O
a O
series O
of O

out O
any O
of O
the O
gross O
violations O
of O
human O
rights O
which O
Tutu O

investigating O

Human O
rights O
lawyer O
Brian O
Currin O
said O
the O
hearings O
last O
week O
were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O
form O
of O
confessional O
and O
that O
those O
who O
personally O
committed O
crimes O
during O
apartheid O
would O
testify O
only O
before O
a O
separate O
arm O
of O
the O
commission O
, O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
one O
should O
have O
expected O
more O
than O
what O
one O
got O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

That O
was O
not O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
where O
perpetrators O
are O
expected O
to O
open O
their O
hearts O
and O
souls O
and O
to O
tell O
it O

" O

The O
commission O
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
grant O
amnesty O
to O
those O
who O
confess O
to O
abuses O
, O
has O
begun O
hearing O
the O
testimony O
from O
people O
already O
in O
jail O
for O
their O
deeds O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O
police O

Dirk B-PER
Coetzee I-PER
, O
have O
yet O
to O
testify O
. O

Tutu B-PER
's O
deputy O
chairman O
, O
Alex B-PER
Boraine I-PER
, O
told O
reporters O
the O
commission O
would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O
appear O
voluntarily O
some O
time O
this O
week O
. O

He O
added O
that O
former O
hardline O
apartheid O
president O
P.W. B-PER
Botha I-PER
could O
be O
among O
those O
called O
. O

But O
Currin B-PER
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
achieve O
the O
commission O
's O
aims O
. O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
" O

He O
cited O
Coetzee O
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O
media O
interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O
. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O
to O
start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin O
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O
approached O
the O
truth O
commission O

of O

left O
many O

" O

it O

I O

some O
doubts O

Thousands O

Bosnia B-LOC

As O
a O
result O

with O

that O
what O
was O
billed O
as O
an O
electoral O
process O
to O
reintegrate O
Bosnia O
as O
a O
single O
, O
multi-ethnic O

" O
The O
main O
point O
of O
this O

is O
to O
highlight O

" O
Eleven O

Gilbertson B-PER

" O
I O

In O
a O
break O
from O

the O

player O
Todd B-PER

expressed O

' O
outrage O
at O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O
Open O
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O
our O
sport O
, O
" O
Martin B-PER
said O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-ORG
. O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich O
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O
's O
last O
Grand O
Slam O
. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich O
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. O
Open O
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American O
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich O
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open O
final O
to O
Andre O
Agassi B-PER
. O

It O
was O
Agassi B-PER
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O

completed O
on O

The O
flamboyant O
American O

was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP O

of O
eight O
to O
a O

of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi B-PER

should O
be O

the O
way O

is O
playing O

right O
now O
, O
" O
said O

about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi B-PER
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O

Wimbledon O
. O

Stich O
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O

himself O
after O
Kafelnikov B-PER

Ranked O

Alexander O
Lebed B-PER
may O
finally O
get O
to O
discuss O
his O
Chechen O
peace O
proposals O
with O
Boris O
Yeltsin O
on O
Tuesday O
after O
a O
lost O
weekend O
in O
the O
region O
when O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
abandon O
plans O
to O
sign O
a O
new O
political O
treaty O
with O
the O
separatist O
rebels O
. O

Despite O
a O
mood O
of O
compromise O
in O
the O
region O
after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O
war O
, O
Lebed B-PER
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O
, O
somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow B-LOC
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya B-LOC
remain O
part O
of O
Russia B-LOC
, O
will O
be O
no O
easy O
matter O
. O

A O
chain-smoking O
former O
paratroop O
general O
with O
a O
sharp O
line O
in O
deadpan O
putdowns O
and O
a O
soldier O
's O
knack O
for O
making O
life O
sound O
simple O
, O
Lebed B-PER
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O
region O
last O
week O
, O
days O
after O
the O
Russian O
army O
threatened O
to O
bomb O
its O
way O
back O
into O
the O
rebel-held O
Chechen O
capital O
Grozny O
. O

He O
returned O
at O
the O
weekend O
, O
pledging O
to O
conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O
where O
all O
others O
have O
failed O
. O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O

Saying O
he O
needed O
to O
tidy O
up O
legal O
loose O
ends O
on O
the O
deal O
-- O
and O
also O
cover O
his O
back O
against O
unnamed O
pro-war O
schemers O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
-- O
he O
flew O
back O
to O
the O
capital O
empty-handed O
on O
Sunday O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O
of O
Yeltsin B-PER

holiday O
, O
announced O
later O
, O
would O
affect O
plans O

talk O

But O
Chernomyrdin O
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B-PER
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan O
Maskhadov O
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin O
. O

Lebed B-PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow O
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O

Maskhadov O
warned O
that O
Lebed B-PER
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O

blown O
up O

Andrei B-PER
Medvedev I-PER
exchanged O
his O
reputation O
as O
the O
clown O
prince O
of O
tennis O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
a O
new O
no-nonsense O
attitude O
that O
has O
made O
life O
on O
the O
courts O
fun O
again O
. O

" O
I O

I O

much O
more O
focused O
on O
what O
I O
have O
to O
do O
, O
and O
that O
's O
playing O

, O
" O
Medvedev B-PER
said O
after O
routing O
Frenchman O
Jean-Philippe B-PER
Fleurian I-PER
6-2 O
6-0 O
6-1 O
in O
the O
opening O
round O
of O
the O
U.S. O

. O

It O
was O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
sixth O
victory O
in O
a O
row O
after O
winning O
his O
first O
tournament O
of O
the O
year O
last O
week O
at O
the O
Hamlet O
Cup O
. O

" O
I O
realised O
this O
year O
, O
that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev B-PER
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O
tennis O
. O

For O
Medvedev B-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O
issues O
such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O
food O
in O
the O
players O
lounge O
, O
an O
entertaining O
rant O
that O
took O
his O
mind O
off O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
. O

" O
I O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
here O
for O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev B-PER
, O
who O
lost O
in O
the O
second O
round O
of O
the O
Open O
the O
last O
two O
years O
after O
reaching O
the O
quarters O
in O
1993 O
, O
the O
same O
year O
he O
tried O
his O
hand O
as O
a O
restaurant O
critic O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
not O
here O
to O
fight O
the O
press O
or O
talk O
about O
the O
food O
or O
entertain O
the O

off O

I O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O

, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French O
Open O
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian O
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O
months O
ago O
. O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev B-PER
hired O
Australian O
coach O
Bob B-PER
Brett I-PER
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O
pay O
off O
. O

" O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

we O
started O
from O
zero O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev B-PER
. O
" O

Winning O
in O
Long O
Island O
( O
last O
week O
) O
was O
like O
winning O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
" O

In O
the O
original O
draw O
, O
Medvedev B-PER
and O
Fleurian O
were O
slotted O
to O
play O
each O
other O
. O

When O

forced O
the O

over O

against O
odds O
of O
151-to-1 O
-- O
Medvedev B-PER

Fleurian O
drew O
each O

a O

" O
When O
I O

I O
did O

have O
to O
change O
my O

" O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall O
Street O
this O
week O
as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O

might O
forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
if O
President O

re-elected O
. O

Concern O
centred O
on O
the O
currency O
markets O
since O
Rubin O
's O
tour O
de O
force O
has O
been O
his O
unflagging O
support O
of O
the O

. O

Should O
Rubin O
leave O
, O
Wall B-LOC

would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O
policy O

him O
. O

" O
Obviously O
, O
under O
the O
Clinton B-PER
administration O
, O
we O
've O
seen O
two O
distinctively O
different O
dollar O
policies O
, O
" O
said O
Chris B-PER
Widness I-PER
, O
an O
international O
economist O
at O
Chase O
Securities O
Inc. B-ORG
" O
Under O
Rubin B-PER
, O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O
dollar O
. O
" O

Currently O
, O
the O

stands O
at O
about O
1.48 O
marks O
and O
109 O

. O

Rubin O
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
26 O

" O
Rubin O
has O
done O
a O
fine O
job O
in O
that O
position O
, O

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O

" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era O
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
financial O
markets O

Some O
overseas O

might O
shy O
away O
from O
buying O
U.S. O
stocks O
and O

or O
even O
sell O
them O
when O
the O
dollar O
is O
weakening O
. O

As O
for O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury I-ORG
securities O
, O
Widness B-PER
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan O
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve I-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin O
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
" O
said O
Widness B-PER
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. O
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

" O
If O
he O
left O
, O
the O
first O
question O
people O
would O
ask O
the O
next O
guy O
is O
, O
' O
What O
's O
your O
view O
on O
the O

? O
' O

" O
And O
all O
I O
can O
say O
as O
a O
piece O
of O
advice O
is O
that O
they O
'd O
better O
say O
exactly O
the O
same O
thing O
( O
as O

if O
