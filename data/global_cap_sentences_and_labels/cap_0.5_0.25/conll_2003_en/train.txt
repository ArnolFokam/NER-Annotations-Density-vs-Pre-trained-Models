of O

Just O
a O

the O

to O
disgust O

Dutroux O
led O

to O
the O
bodies O

two O
eight-year-old O
girls O

of O

nine O

The O

there O

At O

the O
speculation O
in O
the O
Belgian O

of O
high-level O
protection O

Dutroux O

is O

the O

the O
fact O
that O

against O

-- O
when O
both O
Julie O

Melissa O

An O

They O
show O
that O
the O

were O
aware O
that O
Dutroux O
was O
building O
cells O
in O
some O
of O
his O
houses O
for O

Brian O
Currin O
said O
the O
hearings O
last O

were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O

that O
those O
who O

the O
only O
way O

if O

it O
carried O
a O

needed O

it O
for O
the O

despite O
a O
variety O
of O

setbacks O
. O

We O
've O
had O
substantial O
production O
difficulties O
at O
a O
number O
of O
our O
operations O
. O

The O
most O
obvious O
one O
with O
the O
greatest O
effect O
on O
the O
corporation O
was O
at O

where O
we O
had O

of O
176 O

from O

Not O
only O
did O
the O

lock O
in O
3.92 O

in O
February O
/ O
March O
, O
but O
it O
suffered O

last O
August O
. O

Nor O
was O
Implats O
the O
only O
operation O

in O
Mpumulanga B-LOC
province O
. O

But O
Gilbertson O
said O
the O
greatest O
gloom O
in O
the O
year O
came O
from O
the O
European O
Commission O

blocking O
of O

' O
proposed O

with O
Lonrho O

" O
The O
big O
disappointment O
for O
the O
year O
was O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
platinum O
merger O
. O

Overall O
a O
very O
substantial O
pruning O
... O

He O
added O
that O
the O
group O
still O
had O
about O
85 O
million O
rand O
after O

invested O
in O
various O
shares O
, O
which O
were O

Referring O
to O
Gencor O
's O
increased O
41.5 O

in O
Ingwe O
, O
Gilbertson B-PER
said O
the O
group O
would O
wait O
for O
coal O
shares O
to O
be O
cheaper O
before O
considering O
snapping O
up O
more O
. O

" O
I O
think O
we O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
more O
of O
Ingwe O

it O

" O
I O
still O
feel O
it O
's O
embarrassing O
what O
happened O
and O
I O
was O
about O
to O
pull O
out O
yesterday O
and O
say O
, O
' O
That O
's O
it O
, O
' O
" O
said O
Stich O
, O
one O
of O
a O
host O
of O
men O
who O
cried O
foul O
over O
seeding O
procedures O
that O
forced O
an O
unprecedented O
remaking O
of O
the O
men O
's O
draw O
last O
week O
. O

" O
But O
there O
are O
so O
many O
reasons O
to O
play O
, O
especially O
spectators O
and O
the O
kids O
who O
come O
out O
here O
and O
want O
to O
enjoy O
watching O
tennis O
, O
that O
I O
decided O
to O
stay O
. O
" O

In O
a O
break O
from O
tradition O
, O
the O
Open O
did O
not O
seed O
in O
strict O
accordance O
with O
ATP O
rankings O
, O
instead O
taking O
into O
account O
other O
factors O
that O
raised O
objections O
of O
favourtism O
toward O
U.S. O
players O
. O

One O
prominent O
player O
that O
did O
not O
stay O
for O
the O
Open O
was O
French O
Open O
champion O
Yvegeny O
Kafelnikov O
, O
who O
after O
being O
dropped O
three O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B-ORG
ranking O
to O
a O
seventh O
seeding O
, O
withdrew O
and O
returned O
home O
to O
Russia O
. O

Kafelnikov B-PER
had O
pulled O
out O
of O
last O
week O
's O
tournament O
with O
a O
rib O
injury O
. O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O
Open O
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O
our O
sport O
, O
" O
Martin B-PER
said O
. O

Stich O
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B-PER
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O
's O
last O
Grand O
Slam O
. O

Gustafsson I-PER

and O
two-time O

Open O
champion O
Sergi O
Bruguera O
of O
Spain B-LOC
, O
who O
will O
be O
Stich O
's O
next O
opponent O
. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich O
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. O
Open O
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

It O
was O
Agassi O
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American O
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP O
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi O
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi O
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French O
Open O
and O
Wimbledon O
. O

Stich O
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov O
withdrew O
. O

But O
Stich O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O
the O
top O
16 O
deserves O
to O
be O

MOSCOW O
1996-08-26 O

Despite O
a O
mood O
of O
compromise O
in O
the O
region O
after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O
war O
, O
Lebed O
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O
, O
somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow O
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya O
remain O
part O
of O
Russia O
, O
will O
be O
no O
easy O
matter O
. O

He O
returned O
at O
the O
weekend O
, O
pledging O
to O
conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O
where O
all O
others O
have O
failed O
. O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed O
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya O
as O
Yeltsin B-PER
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

Lebed B-PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow O
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov B-PER
warned O
that O
Lebed O
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens O
say O
-- O
Russian O
forces O
. O

Maskhadov O
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed O
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin O
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O

" O

Analysts O
blame O
, O
at O

partly O
, O
Hungary O

macroeconomic O
environment O

now O

about O
55 O

, O

were O
convinced O

" O

" O

" O
Cofinec O

, O
" O
Sitanyi O
said O
, O
saying O
that O
several O
recent O
moves O
by O
Cofinec O
boosted O
its O
position O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
he O
noted O
that O
Cofinec O
had O
acquired O
the O
outstanding O

in O
its O
Czech O
folding O
company O
Krpaco O
a.s. O
, O
increasing O
its O
ownership O

100 O

in O
the O

the O

be O
consolidated O

development O
captivated O
the O
thousands O

at O

clearly O
worried O
some O
Democrats O
, O
who O

" O

days O
for O

, O
" O
Feinstein O
said O

The O
50-year-old O

of O
Morris O
, O
who O
had O
advised O
Clinton O
to O
chart O
a O
more O
centrist O
political O
course O
, O
would O
make O
Clinton O
drift O
back O
to O
the O
left O
. O

" O
Morris O
has O
been O
trying O
to O
make O
President O
Clinton O
a O
Republican O
, O
now O
maybe O
he O
'll O
revert O
to O
the O

that O
he O
really O
is O

" O
Dole O
told O

I O

our O

judgment O
at O

that O

probably O

I O

the O
difference O

not O
actually O

equally O
we O

" O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O

half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O

the O

the O

that O

" O
It O

show O
how O
easily O
we O

bounce O
back O

We O
continue O

average O
