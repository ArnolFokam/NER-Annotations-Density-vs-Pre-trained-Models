Lauck O

It O
was O

the O

-- O
three O
percent O

that O

Trading O
sources O
generally O
agreed O
it O
would O
be O
cost-effective O
to O
take O
the O
copper O
back O
into O
a O
depleted O

it O
had O

A O
backwardation O

is O
higher O
than O
the O
forward O
price O

85,000 O

onto O
the O

between O

down O
to O
115,000 O
tonnes O
from O
200,000 O

previously O
. O

Traders O
in O
Asia O
said O
CNIEC O
could O
well O
have O
lent O
it O
to O
the O
market O
at O
around O
US$ O
2,700 O
a O
tonne O
, O
and O
then O
paid O
somewhere O
between O
$ O
2,200 O

$ O
2,400 O
a O
tonne O
when O
it O
started O
taking O
the O
metal O
back O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

This O
would O
have O
cleared O
CNIEC O
a O
healthy O

could O

have O
been O
used O
to O

decline O
to O

just O
what O

Just O
a O
day O
later O
the O

euphoria O
at O

turned O
to O

two O
eight-year-old O

The O

the O
speculation O
in O
the O
Belgian O

of O
high-level O
protection O
for O
Dutroux O

degree O

They O
show O
that O

aware O
that O
Dutroux O
was O
building O
cells O
in O
some O

Commission O
last O

to O
paint O
the O
broad O

F.W. O

and O
African O
National O

What O
it O
comes O
down O

is O
this O
: O
If O

" O
I O
still O
feel O
it O
's O
embarrassing O
what O
happened O
and O
I O
was O
about O
to O
pull O
out O
yesterday O
and O
say O
, O
' O
That O
's O
it O
, O
' O
" O
said O
Stich O
, O
one O
of O
a O
host O
of O
men O
who O
cried O
foul O
over O
seeding O
procedures O
that O
forced O
an O
unprecedented O
remaking O
of O
the O
men O
's O
draw O
last O
week O
. O

One O
prominent O
player O
that O
did O
not O
stay O
for O
the O
Open O
was O
French O
Open O
champion O
Yvegeny O
Kafelnikov O
, O
who O
after O
being O
dropped O
three O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP O
ranking O
to O
a O
seventh O
seeding O
, O
withdrew O
and O
returned O
home O
to O
Russia O
. O

Kafelnikov O
had O
pulled O
out O
of O
last O
week O
's O
tournament O
with O
a O
rib O
injury O
. O

Stich O
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich O
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. O
Open O
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American O
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich O
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open O
final O
to O
Andre O
Agassi O
. O

It O
was O
Agassi O
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American O
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP O
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi O
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich O
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi O
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French O
Open O
and O
Wimbledon O
. O

Ranked O
18th O
in O
the O
world O
, O
Stich O
might O
have O
been O
slipped O
into O
that O
spot O
ahead O
of O
Spain O

Felix O
Mantilla O
, O
who O
is O

had O
never O

and O
had O
been O
left O
out O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O

everybody O
else O

Despite O
a O
mood O
of O
compromise O
in O
the O
region O
after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O
war O
, O
Lebed O
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O
, O
somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow O
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya O
remain O
part O
of O
Russia O
, O
will O
be O
no O
easy O
matter O
. O

He O
returned O
at O
the O
weekend O
, O
pledging O
to O
conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O
where O
all O
others O
have O
failed O
. O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O

He O
met O
Russian O
Prime O
Minister O
Viktor O
Chernomyrdin O
on O
Monday O
and O
, O
according O
to O
the O
press O
service O
of O
Lebed O
's O
Security O
Council O
, O
could O
meet O
Yeltsin O
on O
Tuesday O
. O

Moscow O
's O
as O
yet O
undisclosed O
proposals O
on O
Chechnya O
's O
political O
future O
have O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
been O
sent O
back O
to O
do O
the O
rounds O
of O
various O
government O
departments O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin O
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed O
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan O
Maskhadov O
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin O
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed O
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow O
. O

Lebed O
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow O
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov O
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed O
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin O
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin O
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya O
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
-- O
something O
Moscow O
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North O
Caucasus O
. O

Lebed O
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O
. O

He O
would O
continue O
working O
on O
various O
documents O
and O
might O
meet O
" O
one O
state O
offical O
or O
another O
" O
. O

Many O
of O
those O
documents O
return O
to O
the O

's O

the O

impact O

's O
figures O
, O
the O
analysts O
said O
. O

Despite O
the O
current O
difficulties O
, O
however O
, O
analysts O
were O
convinced O
that O
Cofinec O
's O
outlook O
was O
strong O
. O

Just O
like O
many O
other O
companies O
on O
the O
bourse O
, O
Cofinec O
has O
big O
growth O
opportunities O
. O
" O

" O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
's O
an O
advantage O
for O
Cofinec O
that O
it O
has O
a O
foreign O
management O
which O
perhaps O
understands O
the O
market O
better O
, O
" O
Erdei O
added O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
he O
noted O
that O
Cofinec O
had O
acquired O
the O
outstanding O
stake O
in O
its O
Czech O
folding O
company O
Krpaco O
a.s. O
, O
increasing O
its O
ownership O
to O
100 O
percent O
, O
so O
in O
the O
second O
half O
the O
whole O
of O
Krpaco O
's O
figures O
will O
be O
consolidated O
. O

The O
company O
also O
repaid O
some O
$ O
21 O
million O
of O
debt O
, O
well O
above O
the O
originally O
planned O

Neither O

into O

after O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O

Arnold O
Ruutel O
, O
have O
secured O
the O
68 O
votes O
necessary O
from O
the O
101-member O
parliament O
. O

A O
third O
and O
final O
vote O
was O
due O
to O
be O
held O
when O
parliament O
reconvened O
on O
Tuesday O
but O
legislators O
were O
not O
expecting O
a O
clear O
result O
. O

If O
there O
is O
no O
result O
the O
decision O
will O
be O
ceded O
to O
an O
electoral O
college O
. O

" O
The O
votes O
are O
a O
strong O
message O
to O
Meri O
that O
he O
is O
not O
favoured O
by O
some O
politicians O
any O
more O
, O
" O
Reform O
Party O
head O
Heiki O
Kranich O
told O
Reuters O
. O

His O
only O
political O
role O
is O
to O
smoothe O
the O
functioning O
of O
government O
in O
periods O
of O
crisis O
. O

But O
Meri O
, O
67 O
, O
has O
been O
accused O
in O
parliament O
of O
taking O
too O
much O
power O
and O
not O
always O
consulting O
parliamentarians O
before O
making O
decisions O
. O

His O
support O
in O
the O
first O
round O
of O
voting O
on O
Monday O
was O
much O
lower O
than O
expected O
, O
scoring O
only O
45 O
votes O
, O
which O
political O
analysts O
put O
down O
as O
a O
vote O
of O
no O
confidence O
in O
his O
performance O
. O

This O
support O
only O
inched O
up O
to O
49 O
in O
the O
second O
vote O
. O

Parliamentary O
organisers O
said O
the O
exact O
timetable O
remained O
unclear O
but O
it O
would O
probably O
take O
about O
a O
month O
to O
organise O
an O

which O
could O
also O
hold O
several O

WASHINGTON O

The O
Securities O

Exchange O
Commission O
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O

rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O

, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O

order O
executed O
at O

. O

The O
director O
of O
the O
SEC O
's O
division O
of O

, O
Richard O
Lindsey O
, O
said O
Wall O

firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC O
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O
bid O
" O
and O
" O
ask O
" O
quotations O
from O

and O

makers O
who O

The O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall O
Street O
this O
week O
as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O
Robert O
Rubin O
might O
forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury O
secretary O
if O
President O
Clinton O
is O
re-elected O
. O

Concern O
centred O
on O
the O
currency O
markets O
since O
Rubin O
's O
tour O
de O
force O
has O
been O
his O
unflagging O
support O
of O
the O
dollar O
. O

That O
strategy O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
timely O
instances O
of O
joint O
central O
bank O
intervention O
, O
helped O
the O
dollar O
battle O
back O
from O

Rubin O
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
26 O
years O
on O
Wall O
Street O
, O

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O
fill O
. O
" O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United O
States O
, O
" O
said O
Widness O
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. O
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury O
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin O
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White O
House O
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
currency O
. O

" O
If O
he O
left O
, O
the O
first O
question O
people O
would O
ask O
the O
next O
guy O
is O
, O
' O
What O
's O
your O
view O
on O
the O
dollar O
? O
' O

" O
And O
all O
I O
can O
say O
as O
a O
piece O
of O
advice O
is O
that O
they O
'd O
better O
say O
exactly O
the O
same O
thing O
( O
as O
Rubin O
) O
, O
if O
not O
stronger O
, O
