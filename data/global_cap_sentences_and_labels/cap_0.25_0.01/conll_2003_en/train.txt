Corporate O
America O
is O
planning O
major O
changes O
in O
employee O
compensation O
in O
the O
next O
few O
years O
, O
according O
to O
a O
recent O
study O
. O

The O
survey O
, O
conducted O
in O
late O
1995 O
and O
the O
early O
part O
of O
this O
year O
by O
management O
consulting O
firm O
Towers O
Perrin O
, O
showed O
that O
the O
focus O
will O
be O
on O
an O
employee O
's O
overall O
value O
to O
the O
company O
's O
bottom O
line O
-- O
rather O
than O
how O
well O
an O
employee O
performs O
a O
specific O
task O
. O

Presently O
, O
for O
example O
, O
if O
an O
accountant O
's O
job O
involves O
doing O
five O
specific O
tasks O
, O
he O
or O
she O
can O
expect O
a O
certain O
salary O
, O
said O
Sandra O
O'Neal O
, O
a O
Towers O
Perrin O
principal O
. O

Next O
on O
the O
agenda O
for O
these O
firms O
is O
developing O
a O
new O
compensation O
structure O
, O
and O
78 O
percent O
report O
that O
they O
are O
considering O
a O
new O
, O
skills-based O
plan O
for O
both O
management O
and O
non-management O
employees O
. O

It O
's O
an O
inexorable O
change O
. O
" O

Now O
organisations O
must O
change O
to O
stay O
competitive O
. O

O'Neal O
says O
firms O
will O
place O
a O
greater O
emphasis O
on O
teams O
and O
team O
performance O
in O
giving O
raises O
. O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
do O
well O
, O
do O
n't O
expect O
a O
raise O
. O

Is O
this O
fair O
to O
an O
employee O
who O
can O
go O
the O
distance O
but O
is O
on O
a O
team O
that O
ca O
n't O
keep O
up O
? O

It O
's O
not O
a O
question O
we O
ask O
any O
more O
. O

Those O
companies O
also O
said O
they O
already O
offer O
employees O
variable O
pay O
and O
business O
education O
, O
give O
their O
managers O
more O
control O
over O
pay O
decisions O
and O
celebrate O
employee O
and O
team O
success O
. O

" O
They O
respect O
employees O
more O
, O
they O
trust O
employees O
more O
and O
they O
value O
their O
employees O
more O
, O

that O

The O

, O
Afghanistan O

to O

, O
has O
been O
controlled O

in O

. O

The O
decline O
is O
all O
the O
worse O
for O

who O
recall O
wasteful O
Soviet O
times O
, O
when O
the O

still O
better O
than O
the O

of O

1996-08-26 O

One O
prominent O
player O
that O
did O
not O
stay O
for O
the O
Open O
was O
French O
Open O
champion O
Yvegeny O
Kafelnikov O
, O
who O
after O
being O
dropped O
three O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP O
ranking O
to O
a O
seventh O
seeding O
, O
withdrew O
and O
returned O
home O
to O
Russia O
. O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O
Open O
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O
our O
sport O
, O
" O
Martin O
said O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O

" O
said O
Stich O
. O
" O

Stich O
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov O
withdrew O
. O

But O
Stich O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O
the O
top O

deserves O

in O

After O
truce O
, O
Lebed O
faces O
tougher O
Chechen O
problem O
. O

Alexander O
Lebed O
may O
finally O
get O
to O
discuss O
his O
Chechen O
peace O
proposals O
with O
Boris O
Yeltsin O
on O
Tuesday O
after O
a O
lost O
weekend O
in O
the O
region O
when O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
abandon O
plans O
to O
sign O
a O
new O
political O
treaty O
with O
the O
separatist O
rebels O
. O

It O
could O
be O
a O
sobering O
experience O
for O
the O
Kremlin O
security O
chief O
who O
, O
just O
two O
months O
after O
being O
appointed O
by O
the O
president O
and O
two O
heady O
weeks O
after O
taking O
charge O
of O
the O
Chechen O
crisis O
, O
had O
promised O
to O
wrap O
up O
the O
20-month O
war O
by O
the O
weekend O

Despite O
a O
mood O
of O
compromise O
in O
the O
region O
after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O
war O
, O
Lebed O
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O
, O
somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow O
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya O
remain O
part O
of O
Russia O
, O
will O
be O
no O
easy O
matter O
. O

He O
returned O
at O
the O
weekend O
, O
pledging O
to O
conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O
where O
all O
others O
have O
failed O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O
of O
Yeltsin O

announced O
later O
, O
would O
affect O

, O

, O
been O
sent O
back O
to O
do O
the O

of O
various O
government O
departments O
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed O
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow O

Outspoken O
Andrei O
Medvedev O
exchanged O
his O
reputation O
as O
the O
clown O
prince O
of O
tennis O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
a O
new O
no-nonsense O
attitude O
that O
has O
made O
life O
on O
the O
courts O
fun O
again O
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O
tennis O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O
before O
, O
they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O
helping O
me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

I O
have O
much O
less O
fun O
off O
the O
court O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev O
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French O
Open O
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev O
hired O
Australian O
coach O
Bob O
Brett O
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O
pay O
off O
. O

While O
Medvedev O
's O
77-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian O
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
were O
playing O
each O
other O
was O
rather O
remarkable O

a O
rebound O

Hope O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
, O
but O
equally O
we O
're O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
second O
half O
. O
" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope O
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O

had O
pressed O

. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
