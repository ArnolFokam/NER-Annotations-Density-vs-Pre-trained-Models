Alexander O
Lebed O
may O
finally O
get O
to O
discuss O
his O
Chechen O
peace O
proposals O
with O
Boris O
Yeltsin O
on O
Tuesday O
after O
a O
lost O
weekend O
in O
the O
region O
when O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
abandon O
plans O
to O
sign O
a O
new O
political O
treaty O
with O
the O
separatist O
rebels O
. O

Despite O
a O
mood O
of O
compromise O
in O
the O
region O
after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O
war O
, O
Lebed O
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O
, O
somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow O
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya B-LOC
remain O
part O
of O
Russia O
, O
will O
be O
no O
easy O
matter O
. O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O
of O
Yeltsin O
's O
holiday O
, O
announced O
later O
, O
would O
affect O

talk O

as O
yet O
undisclosed O

been O
sent O
back O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed O
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya O
as O
Yeltsin O
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

Lebed O
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O
. O

" O
We O
are O
stubborn O
, O
have O
strength O
and O
time O
to O
persist O
