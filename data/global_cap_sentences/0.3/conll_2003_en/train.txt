of O

a O

knack O

Lebed B-PER
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O

last O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O

that O
Lebed B-PER
was O
operating O
out O
on O

Chechnya B-LOC
as O
Yeltsin B-PER
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O

kept O
out O

then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O

just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B-PER
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov I-PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-PER

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B-PER
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O

verified O
in O

Maskhadov B-PER
warned O
that O

Chernomyrdin B-PER
