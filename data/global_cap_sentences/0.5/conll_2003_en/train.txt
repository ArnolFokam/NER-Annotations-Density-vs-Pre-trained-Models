A O
super O

dropped O

a O
disciplinary O
measure O
after O
arriving O
only O
35 O
minutes O

the O

the O

reach O
413 O

the O

a O

There O
seemed O

the O

off O

What O
it O
comes O
down O

this O
: O
If O

you O

The O
survey O
, O

the O
early O
part O
of O
this O
year O
by O

that O
the O

an O

the O
company O
's O
bottom O
line O
-- O
rather O
than O
how O
well O
an O
employee O
performs O
a O
specific O
task O

In O
addition O
to O
using O
accounting O
skills O
, O
the O
accountant O
will O
also O
have O
to O
be O
creative O
, O
work O
well O
in O
a O

, O
be O
sensitive O

" O
The O
bad O

is O
, O
if O

not O

ca O
n't O
contribute O
to O
a O

, O
to O

the O

, O
you O

be O

" O

But O
as O
the O

" O
O'Neal B-PER

Is O
this O
fair O
to O
an O

who O
can O
go O
the O
distance O
but O
is O
on O
a O

ca O

also O
said O
they O
already O

It O
could O

a O

for O

who O
, O
just O
two O
months O

by O

two O
heady O

A O

and O
a O

, O
Lebed B-PER
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O

last O
week O
, O
days O
after O
the O
Russian O
army O
threatened O
to O
bomb O
its O

back O

He O
returned O

that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O
of O
Yeltsin B-PER

holiday O
, O
announced O
later O
, O
would O
affect O
plans O

talk O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O
plan O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B-PER
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov I-PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-PER
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B-PER
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
. O

Lebed B-PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov B-PER
warned O
that O
Lebed B-PER
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens O
say O
-- O
Russian O
forces O
. O

Maskhadov B-PER
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed B-PER
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B-LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

Chernomyrdin B-PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-LOC
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O

quit O
the O
Russian B-LOC

-- O
something O
Moscow B-LOC

Lebed B-PER

be O

finding O
that O

more O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
this O
week O
as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O
Robert B-PER

might O
forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
if O
President O
Clinton B-PER
is O
re-elected O
. O

Should O
Rubin B-PER
leave O
, O
Wall B-LOC

would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O
policy O

him O
. O

" O
Obviously O
, O
under O
the O
Clinton B-PER
administration O
, O
we O
've O
seen O
two O
distinctively O
different O

" O
said O
Chris B-PER

at O

" O
Under O
Rubin B-PER
, O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O

" O

As O
for O

explained O
that O
Alan B-PER

reappointment O

chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG

and O
the O
outlook O

were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin B-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United B-LOC

, O
" O
said O
Widness B-PER
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. B-LOC
stocks O

, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B-PER
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
