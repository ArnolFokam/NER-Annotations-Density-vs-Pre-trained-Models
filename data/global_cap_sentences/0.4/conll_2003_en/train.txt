nearly O
pulled O

over O

the O

glad O

out O

" O
I O
still O

what O

I O
was O
about O
to O
pull O
out O
yesterday O

say O
, O
' O
That O

it O
, O
' O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
, O
one O
of O
a O
host O
of O
men O
who O
cried O
foul O
over O

that O
forced O
an O
unprecedented O
remaking O
of O
the O

last O

" O
But O
there O
are O
so O
many O
reasons O
to O
play O

spectators O

the O

who O
come O
out O

to O
enjoy O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O

has O
tarnished O

SERIOUS O
MEDVEDEV B-PER
IS O
HAVING O
FUN O
AGAIN O

" O
I O
realised O
this O
year O

that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O

successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev B-PER
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O
before O
, O
they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O
helping O
me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

For O
Medvedev B-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O
issues O
such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O
food O
in O
the O
players O
lounge O
, O
an O
entertaining O
rant O
that O
took O
his O
mind O
off O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
not O
here O
to O
fight O
the O
press O
or O
talk O
about O
the O
food O
or O
entertain O
the O

off O

I O
'm O
here O
to O
play O

" O
It O

somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev B-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

" O
At O
the O

" O
said O
Medvedev B-PER
. O
" O

While O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
77-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian B-PER
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
