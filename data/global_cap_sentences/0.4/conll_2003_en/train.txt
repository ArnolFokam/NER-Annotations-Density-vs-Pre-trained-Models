" O

" O
She O

tough O

She O

Tommy B-PER

In O
a O
break O
from O
tradition O
, O
the O
Open O
did O
not O
seed O
in O
strict O

instead O
taking O

One O
prominent O

that O
did O

was O
French O
Open O
champion O
Yvegeny B-PER
Kafelnikov I-PER
, O
who O
after O

dropped O
three O

withdrew O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-ORG

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B-PER
got O
on O
the O

, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O

win O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American O
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O

" O
said O
Stich B-PER
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O

It O

Stich B-PER
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O

might O

benefitted O

some O
fiddling O

It O
could O
be O
a O
sobering O
experience O
for O

, O
just O
two O
months O

appointed O
by O
the O

two O
heady O
weeks O
after O
taking O

had O
promised O
to O
wrap O
up O
the O

Despite O
a O
mood O
of O
compromise O
in O
the O
region O
after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O

Lebed B-PER
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O

somewhere O
between O
rebel O

Moscow B-LOC

insistence O
that O

will O
be O
no O

A O
chain-smoking O
former O

general O
with O
a O
sharp O
line O

a O
soldier O

knack O

, O
Lebed B-PER
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O

last O
week O
, O
days O
after O
the O

army O
threatened O
to O
bomb O
its O
way O
back O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed B-PER
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
Yeltsin B-PER

hardly O
seen O
since O
his O

kept O
out O

then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O

just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O

insist O
Lebed B-PER
was O
playing O
for O

united O

that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O

Aslan B-PER

been O
agreed O
by O

Lebed B-PER
himself O

was O
concerned O
that O

interests O

who O
have O
profited O
from O

it O

on O
any O

the O

A O

the O
two O

come O

Lebed B-PER
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O

political O
gap O

the O

sides O
is O
more O
difficult O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
this O
week O
as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O
Robert B-PER
Rubin I-PER
might O
forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
if O
President O
Clinton B-PER
is O
re-elected O
. O

Concern O
centred O
on O
the O
currency O
markets O
since O
Rubin B-PER
's O
tour O
de O
force O
has O
been O
his O
unflagging O
support O
of O
the O
dollar O
. O

Speculation O
that O
Rubin B-PER
might O
not O
stay O
in O
his O
post O
grew O
after O
he O
sidestepped O
questions O
about O
any O
future O
Cabinet B-ORG
post O
during O
television O
interviews O
at O
the O
Democratic O
convention O
in O
Chicago B-LOC
this O
week O
. O

" O
Obviously O
, O
under O
the O
Clinton B-PER
administration O
, O
we O
've O
seen O
two O
distinctively O
different O
dollar O
policies O
, O
" O
said O
Chris B-PER
Widness I-PER
, O
an O
international O
economist O
at O
Chase B-ORG
Securities I-ORG
Inc. I-ORG
" O
Under O
Rubin B-PER
, O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O
dollar O
. O
" O

Rubin B-PER
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
26 O
years O
on O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
part O
of O
which O
were O
spent O
as O
co-chairman O
of O
Goldman B-ORG
, I-ORG
Sachs I-ORG
and I-ORG
Co I-ORG
. I-ORG

As O
for O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury I-ORG
securities O
, O
Widness B-PER
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan I-PER
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve I-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin B-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B-PER
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
currency O
