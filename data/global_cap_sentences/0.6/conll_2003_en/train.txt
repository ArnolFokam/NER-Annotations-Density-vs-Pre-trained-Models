the O

one O
of O
a O

there O

One O

who O
after O

three O

" O
I O

we O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O

focused O
his O
energies O

" O
I O
get O
the O

that O
everything O

here O
for O
the O
American O

forget O
about O
all O

who O
lost O
the O
1994 O

the O

not O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O

that O
Lebed B-PER
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
Yeltsin B-PER
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O

, O
kept O
out O

and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O

as O
he O
clinched O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O

insist O
Lebed B-PER

that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER

had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-PER

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O

at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin B-PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-LOC

future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O

letting O

the O
Russian B-LOC

something O

particularly O
in O
the O

Lebed B-PER
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O

more O

" O

As O

" O
These O

Medvedev B-PER

slowly O

It O

, O
a O

Kiely B-PER

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O

numbers O

, O
that O

The O

the O

the O

" O
he O

The O
reaction O

who O
seized O
on O
research O

saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O

faster O

there O
was O
no O

some O
147,000 O

it O

reluctantly O

placate O
its O

. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O

be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O

away O

Speculation O
that O

the O

" O

we O

get O
someone O
that O
