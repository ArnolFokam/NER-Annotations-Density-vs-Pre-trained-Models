Both O

a O
year O

The O
fate O

the O

unknown O

there O
has O
been O
speculation O
they O
were O
sold O
into O

in O
Slovakia B-LOC

the O
Czech B-LOC

where O
Dutroux B-PER

At O

the O
speculation O
in O
the O
Belgian O
media O
of O
high-level O
protection O

Among O
the O
revelations O
are O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

against O

when O
both O
Julie B-PER

An B-PER

They O
show O
that O
the O

aware O
that O
Dutroux B-PER

building O
cells O
in O

of O

Chris B-PER

his O
best O
to O
forget O
his O
controversial O
omission O
from O
the O
England B-LOC
one-day O

A O
super O

attempting O

man O
where O
Lewis B-PER
was O
lurking O
with O
a O
point O

. O

There O
seemed O
scant O
danger O
until O
the O
Surrey B-ORG

swooped O
on O
to O
the O
ball O

returned O
off O

The O
maul O

there O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
go O
in O

I O
thought O
I O

hold O

we O
had O
the O
ball O

When O

he O

I O

I O
just O
hit O
through O
and O
I O
was O
punching O

It O

The O

one O

It O

the O

the O

was O
there O
. O
' O

We O
were O

there O
was O
nowhere O

they O
just O
kept O
coming O
at O
you O

I O
was O
gone O
in O

first O
20 O

completely O
exhausted O

you O
had O
no O

There O

Currin I-PER
said O
the O

last O

were O
not O

that O
those O

I O

The O

which O

the O

grant O

He O
added O
that O

But O
Currin B-PER

said O
this O
was O
not O
the O

achieve O
the O
commission O

aims O
. O

Boraine B-PER
said O
the O
picture O
was O
incomplete O
because O

the O
apartheid-era O

had O
yet O
to O
make O
their O
scheduled O
, O

one O
black O
caller O

declared O
: O

" O
This O
whole O
thing O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
us O
at O
all O

What O
the O

is O
to O
have O

" O

Political O

Jannie B-PER

implemented O
apartheid O

began O

it O

it O

needed O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O

Outspoken O
Andrei B-PER
Medvedev I-PER
exchanged O
his O
reputation O
as O
the O
clown O
prince O
of O
tennis O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
a O
new O
no-nonsense O
attitude O
that O
has O
made O
life O
on O
the O
courts O
fun O
again O
. O

It O
was O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
sixth O
victory O
in O
a O
row O
after O
winning O
his O
first O
tournament O
of O
the O
year O
last O
week O
at O
the O
Hamlet O
Cup O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O
before O
, O
they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O
helping O
me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

" O
I O
know O
what O
I O

here O
for O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev B-PER
, O
who O
lost O
in O
the O
second O
round O
of O
the O
Open O
the O
last O
two O
years O
after O
reaching O
the O
quarters O
in O
1993 O
, O
the O
same O
year O
he O
tried O
his O
hand O
as O
a O
restaurant O
critic O
. O

I O
'm O
here O
to O
play O
tennis O
and O
to O
win O
. O

I O
have O
much O
less O
fun O
off O
the O
court O
. O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O
the O
court O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French O
Open O
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian O
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O
months O
ago O
. O

" O
It O
's O
somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev B-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev B-PER
hired O
Australian O
coach O
Bob B-PER
Brett I-PER
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O
pay O
off O
. O

While O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
77-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian B-PER
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
were O
playing O
each O
other O
was O
rather O
remarkable O
. O

In O
the O
original O
draw O
, O
Medvedev B-PER
and O
Fleurian B-PER
were O
slotted O
to O
play O
each O
other O
. O

When O
controversy O
forced O
the O
draw O
to O
be O
done O
over O
-- O
against O
odds O
of O
151-to-1 O
-- O
Medvedev B-PER
and O
Fleurian B-PER
drew O
each O
other O
a O
second O
time O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
destined O
that O
it O
turned O
out O
for O
me O

who O
seized O
on O

he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O

is O
that O
it O

probably O
bumble O
along O

it O

" O

" O
It O
's O
very O
difficult O

It O
could O
be O

it O

and O
a O
rebound O
later O
in O

, O
Hope B-PER
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
, O
but O
equally O
we O
're O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
second O
half O
. O
" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope B-PER
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O
had O
pressed O
margins O

which O
had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African O
) O
mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O
company O
that O

quite O
capable O

it O

" O
When O
the O

bounce O
