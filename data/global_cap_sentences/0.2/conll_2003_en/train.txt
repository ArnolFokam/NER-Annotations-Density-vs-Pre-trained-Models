" O
I O
realised O
this O

that O
without O

into O

, O
I O
do O

" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O

. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O

were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O

me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

For O
Medvedev B-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O

not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O

as O
the O
poor O
quality O

an O

rant O
that O
took O
his O

off O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
. O

But O
Medvedev B-PER
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O

finally O
hit O

somewhere O
where O
I O
would O

" O

It O

I O
have O

Medvedev B-PER
