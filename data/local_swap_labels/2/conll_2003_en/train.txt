one O
of O
a O

there O

out O

In O
a O
break O
from O
tradition O
, O
the O
Open O
did O
not O
seed O
in O
strict O

with O
ATP B-LOC
rankings O
, O
instead O
taking O
into O

other O
factors O
that O
raised O
objections O

U.S. B-ORG

One O
prominent O

that O
did O
not O

the O

was O
French O

Yvegeny B-LOC

who O
after O

Kafelnikov B-ORG

At O

on O

U.S. B-DATE
Davis O

player O
Todd B-ORG

expressed O
the O

' O
outrage O
at O
the O
seedings O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O

has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O

in O
the O

' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O

Martin B-ORG

Stich B-ORG
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-DATE

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O

" O
said O
Stich B-ORG

" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O

cancelled O
out O

The O

lingers O
in O

that O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed B-PER
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-ORG
as O
Yeltsin B-LOC
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O

and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-DATE
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B-LOC
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov I-PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-PER
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B-DATE
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B-ORG
. O

Lebed B-DATE
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-PER
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov B-ORG
warned O
that O
Lebed B-LOC
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O

was O
blown O
up O

Maskhadov B-LOC
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed B-DATE
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B-LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin B-PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-PER
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O

quit O
the O
Russian B-LOC

something O

finding O
that O
closing O

gap O

more O

WASHINGTON B-PER
1996-08-28 O

The O
Securities B-PER
and I-PER
Exchange I-PER
Commission I-PER
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq O
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC B-DATE
Chairman O
Arthur B-LOC
Levitt I-LOC
. O

The O
SEC B-PER
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O

of O

, O
Richard B-PER

, O
said O

firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC B-LOC
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O

the O
SEC B-PER
settled O

. O

The O
SEC B-PER
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O

with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O

executed O
. O

The O

said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O

" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O

" O

makers O
who O

The O
SEC B-LOC

cow O

would O
die O
out O

offered O
little O
prospect O

change O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O

We O
will O
ask O
the O

examine O
it O
, O
" O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O

into O
the O
dynamics O

the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O

, O
a O

" O
We O

which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O

possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O

the O
European B-DATE

a O

which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O

" O
Kiely B-ORG
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O

but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O

the O
number O

" O
he O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O

that O

" O
he O
added O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O

who O
seized O
on O

predicted O

the O

" O
I O
hope O

it O

. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O

we O

I O

our O

that O

I O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O

when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O

the O

the O
fact O
that O

" O
It O

show O
how O
easily O

" O

average O

" O
We O

" O
When O

Fear O
that O

the O

" O

if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O

it O

that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. B-LOC

, O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-LOC

because O
the O
firm O

yielded O
positive O

If O
that O

true O

then O
any O
