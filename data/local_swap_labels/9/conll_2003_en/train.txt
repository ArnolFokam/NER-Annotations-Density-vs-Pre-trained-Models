one O
of O
a O
host O

there O

out O

In O
a O
break O
from O
tradition O
, O
the O
Open O
did O
not O
seed O
in O
strict O

with O
ATP B-PER
rankings O
, O
instead O
taking O
into O

other O
factors O
that O

One O
prominent O

that O
did O

At O

on O

, O
U.S. B-PER
Davis O

player O
Todd B-ORG

the O

' O
outrage O
at O
the O
seedings O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O

has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O

in O
the O

and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O

Martin B-ORG

said O
he O
felt O
the O

to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-PER

did O

really O

" O

I O
feel O

The O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O

that O
Lebed B-DATE
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-PER
as O
Yeltsin B-DATE
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O

and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin B-LOC
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B-DATE
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-ORG
Maskhadov I-ORG
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B-LOC
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B-ORG
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B-ORG
. O

Lebed B-LOC
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-PER
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O

, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov B-LOC
warned O
that O
Lebed B-LOC
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian O
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O

was O
blown O
up O
last O

by O

so O
the O
Chechens O
say O
-- O
Russian O

Maskhadov B-DATE
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed B-DATE
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B-PER
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin B-DATE
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-PER
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O

quit O
the O
Russian B-ORG
Federation I-ORG

something O

encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-DATE

Lebed B-DATE

be O

finding O
that O
closing O

political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O

WASHINGTON B-PER
1996-08-28 O

The O
Securities B-PER
and I-PER
Exchange I-PER
Commission I-PER
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq O
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC B-LOC
Chairman O
Arthur B-ORG
Levitt I-ORG
. O

The O
SEC B-LOC
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O

of O

, O
Richard B-DATE

, O
said O

firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC B-LOC
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O
month O
, O
the O
SEC B-PER
settled O
charges O
of O
alleged O

$ O
100 O

over O
five O
years O
to O
upgrade O
its O
oversight O
of O

. O

The O
SEC B-PER
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
investors O
with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O

executed O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O

improvement O
" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O

" O

makers O
who O

The O

we O

We O

that O

, O
a O

out O
the O

think O
it O

Kiely B-DATE

" O
We O

look O
at O
our O

we O
wo O

" O
We O

he O

The O
reaction O

who O

" O
The O

some O

the O

In O
an O

following O
its O
first-half O
results O
, O
which O
included O
a O
less O
optimistic O
forecast O
for O
the O

taken O

Looking O
at O

prospects O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O
will O
probably O
bumble O
along O
in O
the O
rather O
mixed O
way O
it O

been O
in O
the O
first O

" O

" O
It O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
predict O
the O

this O

It O

be O

it O

the O
end O
of O

T&N B-PER
predicted O
a O
sluggish O
first O
half O
and O
a O
rebound O
later O
in O
1996 O
, O
Hope B-ORG
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O

but O
equally O
we O
're O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
second O
half O

" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope B-DATE
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O

pressed O
margins O

which O
had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African O
) O
mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
10 O
percent O
profit O
margins O
over O
the O
cycle O
. O
" O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O
company O
that O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
working O
in O
difficult O
circumstances O

we O

And O
we O

very O
confident O
that O
we O
're O
doing O
all O
the O
right O

" O
Hope B-ORG
said O
. O

" O
When O
the O
( O

bounce O
back O
up O

Fear O
that O

the O

" O

if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O

that O
could O
hurt O

, O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-ORG

because O
the O

yielded O
positive O

If O
that O

true O

then O
any O
