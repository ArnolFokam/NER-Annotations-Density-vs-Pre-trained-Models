One O

" O
The O
way O
the O

tampering O

It O
was O
Agassi B-PER

was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O

up O
two O

should O

about O

Stich B-PER
, O
not O
seeded O

for O
the O

benefitted O

some O
fiddling O

the O

quote O
one O

to O

a O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O

, O
" O
Kiely B-PER
said O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature B-ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
better O
way O
of O
dealing O
with O
this O
issue O
, O
" O
National B-ORG
Farmers I-ORG
Union I-ORG
president O
Sir O
David B-PER
Naish I-PER
told O
BBC B-ORG
radio I-ORG
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O

scientists O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish B-PER
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain B-LOC
and O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O
ban O
on O
British O
beef O
after O
the O
government O
said O
there O
could O
be O
a O
link O
between O
BSE O
and O
the O
human O
form O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

The O
issue O
flared O
in O
in O
March O
when O

scientists O
admitted O
that O
people O
could O
become O
infected O
with O
Creutzfeldt-Jakob O
Disease O
( O

from O
eating O
BSE-infected O

Thousands O

threw O
up O

across O
France B-LOC
overnight O
, O
stopping O
and O
checking O
lorries O
suspected O
of O
importing O
meat O
from O
outside O
the O
European B-ORG
Union I-ORG
, O
French O
radios O
reported O
on O
Thursday O
. O

Radio O
stations O
said O
around O
15,000 O

, O
angered O
by O
a O
fall O
in O

prices O
following O
the O
mad O
