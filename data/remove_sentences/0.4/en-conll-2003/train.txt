said O
: O
" O
Happily O
the O
strong O
improvement O
in O
financial O
performance O
is O
not O
an O
illusion O
arising O
from O
the O

" O

" O
Not O
everything O
has O
gone O
well O
. O

The O
most O
obvious O
one O
with O
the O
greatest O
effect O
on O
the O

was O
at O
Impala B-ORG

we O
had O
the O

of O
176 O

Not O
only O
did O
the O

lock O
in O
3.92 O

in O

, O
but O
it O

to O

The O

was O

Nor O

Mpumulanga B-LOC

. O

" O
The O
big O
disappointment O
for O
the O
year O
was O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
platinum O

. O

From O
Gencor B-ORG

perspective O
we O
are O
taking O
the O
position O
that O
it O

not O

Gilbertson B-PER

Looking O
ahead O
to O
the O
current O
financial O

he O
said O
that O

" O
Gencor B-ORG

well O
placed O
to O

up O

He O
added O
that O
the O

about O

One O

was O
French O
Open O
champion O
Yvegeny B-PER

who O
after O

dropped O
three O

a O

, O
withdrew O

returned O

At O
a O

by O
approximately O
50 O
players O
on O
Sunday O
, O
U.S. B-LOC
Davis O
Cup O
player O
Todd B-PER
Martin I-PER
expressed O
the O
players O
' O
outrage O
at O
the O

. O

Stich B-PER
said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-ORG

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER

" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O

not O
show O
up O
today O

" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B-PER
got O
on O
the O

, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O

win O
the O

who O
will O
be O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American O
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open O
final O
to O
Andre B-PER
Agassi I-PER
. O

It O
was O
Agassi B-PER
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American O
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B-ORG
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi B-PER
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi B-PER
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French O
Open O
and O
Wimbledon O
. O

Stich B-PER
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov B-PER
withdrew O
. O

But O
Stich B-PER
did O
n't O

I O
realised O
this O
year O
, O
that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev B-PER
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O
tennis O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O
things O
I O
was O
doing O
the O
years O
before O
, O
they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O
helping O
me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

For O
Medvedev B-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O
issues O
such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O
food O
in O
the O

lounge O
, O
an O
entertaining O
rant O
that O
took O
his O
mind O
off O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
. O

I O
have O
much O
less O

I O

much O
more O

on O

" O
he O
said O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French O

winning O
three O
tournaments O

The O
Ukrainian O

hit O
a O
low O

two O

" O
It O
's O
somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev B-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev B-PER
hired O
Australian O

Bob B-PER
Brett I-PER
at O
the O

the O

In O

Medvedev B-PER

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU B-ORG
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission B-ORG
spokesman O
Gerard B-PER
Kiely I-PER
told O
Reuters B-ORG
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O
cattle O
, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain B-LOC
and O
its O
14 O
EU B-ORG
partners O
. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE O
cases O
possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE O
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely B-PER
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature B-ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

British O
farmers O
' O
leader O
called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
better O
way O
of O
dealing O
with O
this O
issue O
, O
" O
National B-ORG
Farmers I-ORG
Union I-ORG
president O
Sir O
David B-PER
Naish I-PER
told O
BBC B-ORG
radio I-ORG
. O

Naish B-PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain B-LOC
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European O
partners O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish B-PER
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain B-LOC
and O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O
ban O
on O
British O
beef O
after O
the O
government O
said O
there O
could O
be O
a O
link O
between O
BSE O
and O
the O
human O
form O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

The O
issue O
flared O
in O
in O
March O
when O
government O
scientists O
admitted O
that O
people O
could O
become O
infected O
with O
Creutzfeldt-Jakob O
Disease O
( O
CJD O
) O
from O
eating O
BSE-infected O
