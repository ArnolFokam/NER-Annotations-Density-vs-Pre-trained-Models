play O
the O
first O

over O
the O

Angeles B-PER
Montolio I-PER

I O
was O
really O
concentrating O
on O
keeping O
my O

momentum O
and O
my O
own O
rhythm O
. O

" O
She O
is O
tough O
to O
play O
in O
that O
way O
because O
she O
plays O
very O
up O
and O
down O
. O

Huber B-PER
, O
who O
reached O
the O

a O
week O

at O

could O
only O
mourn O
her O

It O

always O
tough O
to O

somebody O
like O
that O
in O
the O
first O

in O
a O
Grand O

" O
I O
think O
I O
did O

" O
I O
hope O

The O

was O
cool O
in O
her O

" O
In O
terms O

I O
think O
the O
junior O

really O
good O

" O
But O
there O
are O

spectators O

come O
out O

that O

" O

In O
a O
break O
from O
tradition O
, O
the O
Open O
did O
not O
seed O
in O
strict O

with O
ATP B-ORG
rankings O
, O
instead O
taking O
into O
account O
other O
factors O
that O
raised O
objections O
of O

toward O
U.S. B-LOC
players O

Kafelnikov B-PER
had O
pulled O
out O

At O
a O
news O

by O
approximately O
50 O
players O
on O
Sunday O
, O
U.S. B-LOC
Davis O
Cup O
player O
Todd B-PER
Martin I-PER
expressed O
the O
players O
' O
outrage O
at O
the O
seedings O
. O

" O
The O
way O
the O
U.S. O
Open O
has O
seeded O
here O
, O
tampering O
with O
the O
ranking O
system O
, O
has O
tarnished O
the O
image O
and O
reputation O
of O
this O
U.S. O
Open O
in O
the O
players O
' O
mind O
, O
and O
we O
think O
that O
is O
damaging O
to O
our O
sport O
, O
" O
Martin B-PER
said O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B-ORG
. O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B-PER
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O

last O
Grand O

. O

It O
was O
Agassi B-PER
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American O
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B-ORG
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi B-PER
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi B-PER
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French O
Open O
and O
Wimbledon O
. O

Ranked O
18th O
in O
the O
world O
, O
Stich B-PER
might O
have O
been O
slipped O
into O
that O
spot O
ahead O
of O
Spain B-LOC

Felix B-PER
Mantilla I-PER
, O
who O
is O
16th O
but O
had O
never O
been O
played O

the O

and O
had O
been O
left O
out O
of O
the O
seedings O
originally O
. O

But O
Stich B-PER
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O

The O

. O

In O
proposing O
the O

the O

noted O
that O

It O
also O
cited O
the O

a O

makers O
quote O
one O

quoting O
better O
prices O
in O

, O
thus O
robbing O

the O

The O

NEW B-LOC
YORK I-LOC

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
this O
week O
as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O
Robert B-PER
Rubin I-PER
might O
forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
if O
President O
Clinton B-PER
is O
re-elected O
. O

Should O
Rubin B-PER
leave O
, O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O
policy O
with O
him O
. O

Rubin B-PER
's O
predecessor O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
, O
Lloyd B-PER
Bentsen I-PER
, O
was O
viewed O
with O
suspicion O
by O
some O
in O
the O
financial O
markets O
who O
thought O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
push O
down O
the O
dollar O
to O
gain O
an O
edge O
in O
trade O
negotiations O
with O
Japan B-LOC
. O

That O
strategy O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
timely O
instances O
of O
joint O
central O
bank O
intervention O
, O
helped O
the O
dollar O
battle O
back O
from O
post-Second O
World O
War O
lows O
of O
1.3438 O
German O
marks O

, O
1995 O
, O
and O
79.75 O
Japanese O
yen O
on O
April O
19 O
, O
1995 O
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
dollar O
stands O
at O
about O
1.48 O
marks O
and O
109 O
yen O
. O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era O
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
financial O
markets O
. O

As O
for O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury I-ORG
securities O
, O
Widness B-PER
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan I-PER
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve I-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin B-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B-PER
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
