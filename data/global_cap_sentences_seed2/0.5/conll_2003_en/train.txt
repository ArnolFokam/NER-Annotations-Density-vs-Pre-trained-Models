somewhere O

Moscow B-LOC

according O

that O

the O

come O
close O

a O

both O

involving O
a O

Both O

the O

Despite O

, O

were O
convinced O

strong O

" O
Cofinec B-ORG
is O
a O
very O
good O
story O
in O
the O
long-term O
as O
the O

" O
Sitanyi B-PER

, O
saying O
that O
several O
recent O

its O
position O

Among O

, O
he O
noted O
that O

Czech O
folding O
company O
Krpaco B-ORG
a.s. I-ORG
, O
increasing O
its O
ownership O

100 O

so O
in O
the O
second O
half O
the O
whole O
of O
Krpaco B-ORG

figures O
will O
be O
consolidated O

The O

In O
