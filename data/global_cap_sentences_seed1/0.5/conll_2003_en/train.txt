the O

felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O

needed O

be O
exculpated O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O

" O
I O
still O

what O

was O
about O

pull O

say O
, O
' O
That O

it O

' O
" O
said O
Stich B-PER
, O
one O
of O
a O
host O
of O
men O
who O
cried O
foul O
over O

procedures O
that O
forced O
an O
unprecedented O
remaking O

Kafelnikov B-PER
had O
pulled O
out O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O

" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O

he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O

last O
Grand O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American O
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O

the O

right O

" O
said O

about O
the O
unfairness O

moving O
up O
Agassi B-PER

who O
made O
early O
exits O

. O

Stich B-PER
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O

might O
have O
benefitted O

some O
fiddling O

himself O
after O
Kafelnikov B-PER
withdrew O

Ranked O
18th O

that O

If O
that O

it O
was O

found O
it O
necessary O
to O

Lebed B-PER
himself O

him O

Maskhadov B-PER
may O
also O
have O

on O
Lebed B-PER
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O

what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

Chernomyrdin B-PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O

but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O

The O
European B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain B-LOC
's O
mad O
cow O
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
2001 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would O
change O
an O
agreed O
slaughter O
campaign O
. O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE O
cases O
possible O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British O
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature B-ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
340 O
new O
infections O
and O
14,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
BSE O
before O
2001 O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O

in O
fact O
scientists O

Europe B-LOC
accepted O

The O

could O
well O

slapped O
