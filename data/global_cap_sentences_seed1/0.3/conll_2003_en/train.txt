Hope B-PER

: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O

is O
the O
first O

has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O

equally O
we O

Against O
this O

Hope B-PER

the O

was O
glad O
it O

rationalised O

even O

had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O

. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O

and O
the O

that O
we O

the O

" O
When O
the O
