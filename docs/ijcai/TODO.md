Viz
- [x] Make  plots more intuitive (Micheal)
- [ ] Viz for entropy experiments (Manuel) ðŸ¥¹
- [x] Add a couple of tables or plots showcasing the dataset characteristics, e.g. how many sentences have X entities, etc.
- [x] get the number of sentences for each dataset. (Manuel)

Experiments
- [ ] Mean & Std prediction entropy for each corrupted dataset and model?  (4 models x 11 languages x 5 corruptions x 10 params)(Manuel) ðŸ¥¹
- [x] For global cap sentences, other random seeds when creating the data, not just running it?
