    Does in effect what we try, i.e. zero shot transfer, just on RC tasks (e.g. Squad). 
    
    Section 3 has some details about what the models learn.
    
    
    mBert does not totally rely on pattern matching.

    They have a very cool picture of PCA BERT embeddings before and after finetuning.

    Pretty cool. Could do similar stuff just for NER on african languages.

    The question is what languages to transfer from?


    They do cite some things that use transfer learning to improve NER !!! named entity recognition (Zhang et al., 2016; Mayhew et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018),


    TLDR, many features impact transfer learning performance.

    TLDR, do NER systems use context, or are they merely memorising the words themselves? That is the main question.


    NER struggles usually when training on unseen entities.


    Their experiment is quite clever, in that they use either only words or only context and see what the models predict when given only one. They find that the main reason is that the words are in effect being remembered.

    "The number of examples for which relying primarily on contextual features will result
    in an accurate prediction is almost the same as the number for which relying on the
    context will lead to an erroneous prediction"

    Gazetteers are in effect large lookup tables that list common names and such.


    Only words is better than only contexts, but both are better still.

    Their discussion is pretty neat.

    They say zero shot is bad for languages not in training set. They say most investigations into this has been on low level tasks (like NER), and they focus on higher level.

    Nice related work section.


    Seems cool: Additional work has been done examining what mechanisms allow multilingual models to transfer across languages (Pires et al., 2019; Wu and
Dredze, 2019). Wu and Dredze (2020) examine
transfer performance dependent on a language’s
representation in the pretraining data



TLDR: Somewhat cool, don't really say much though

    Introduction says what analysis has been done (maybe can be for ideas).

    Cite this: Nevertheless, mBERT performs surprisingly well on zero-shot POS tagging and Named
Entity Recognition (NER), as well as on crosslingual model transfer (Pires et al., 2019).

  Kinda interesting. Could probably do something like: analyse different NER tokens.

Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24{\%} on the majority of datasets. Furthermore, with only 100 labeled examples, it matches the performance of training from scratch on 100 times more data. We open-source our pretrained models and code.",

abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

    This investigates multilingual BERT and how it transfers to other languages, and what affects this transfer.

   Their results show that transfer occurs even when there is 0 token overlap.


   The gist is that word-piece tokenising is much better than word or character tokenising. Also, NSP seems to hurt performance.

   \begin{quote}
   Our contributions are threefold: (i) we provide the first extensive study of the aspects of M-BERT
that give rise to its cross-lingual ability; (ii) we develop a methodology that facilitates the analysis of
similarities between languages and their impact on cross-lingual models; we do this by mapping English to a Fake-English language, that is identical in all aspects to English but shares no word-pieces
with any target language; finally, (iii) we develop a set of insights into B-BERT, along linguistic,
architectural, and learning dimensions, that would contribute to further understanding and to the
development of more advanced cross-lingual neural models.
\end{quote}


  They found that word-piece overlap has a negligible performance impact. Word order is much more relevant. Structural similarity has a large effect. Larger models transfer better. WordPiece is much better overall.



  Pretty solid overall, quite interesting. Would be nice to see works that this cited.

However, these models are known to require a lot of training data. This consequently leaves out a huge percentage of the world{'}s languages as they are under-resourced. Furthermore, a major motivation behind these models is that lower-resource languages benefit from joint training with higher-resource languages. In this work, we challenge this assumption and present the first attempt at training a multilingual language model on only low-resource languages. We show that it is possible to train competitive multilingual language models on less than 1 GB of text. Our model, named AfriBERTa, covers 11 African languages, including the first language model for 4 of these languages. Evaluations on named entity recognition and text classification spanning 10 languages show that our model outperforms mBERT and XLM-Rin several languages and is very competitive overall. Results suggest that our {``}small data{''} approach based on similar languages may sometimes work better than joint training on large datasets with high-resource languages. Code, data and models are released at https://github.com/keleog/afriberta.",

    annote={AfriBERTa. The gist is that traditional transformers, like BERT require very much training data, hindering applicability to many languages that have a scarcity of data.
    
    The results show that they do pretty well, only on low-resourecd languages \& very small datasets.


    They show that only using low-resourced languages works, and gives competitive results. We do not need high-resourced languages to transfer from. Using less than 1GB of text is valid. Indicate some important factors.


    Their background section is quite detailed and descriptive, of other approaches that used very little data to train large language models (seemingly going against common intuition).


    Their \textbf{total} dataset size is less than 1GB - for all languages.

    They use MLM as the objective, and do \textbf{not} use NSP.


    Very competitive with XLM-Roberta, while having much faster training, less params, etc.

    Very cool paper.

In light of the success of these broad-coverage models, we investigate whether it is still helpful to tailor a pretrained model to the domain of a target task. We present a study across four domains (biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews) and eight classification tasks, showing that a second phase of pretraining in-domain (domain-adaptive pretraining) leads to performance gains, under both high- and low-resource settings. Moreover, adapting to the task{'}s unlabeled data (task-adaptive pretraining) improves performance even after domain-adaptive pretraining. Finally, we show that adapting to a task corpus augmented using simple data selection strategies is an effective alternative, especially when resources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be unavailable. Overall, we consistently find that multi-phase adaptive pretraining offers large gains in task performance.",
