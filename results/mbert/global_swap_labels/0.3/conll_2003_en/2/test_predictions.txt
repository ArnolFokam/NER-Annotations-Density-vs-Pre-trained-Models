Lieutenant-General O
Maurice B-LOC
Baril I-LOC
told O
a O
news O

in O
Nairobi B-ORG
his O
main O
concern O
was O
for O
a O
large O
group O
of O
about O
150,000 O

living O
off O

a O

If O
he O
decided O
it O
was O
necessary O

safe O
for O
the O
aircrew O
, O
he O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O
airdrops O
of O
food O
for O
the O
refugees O
, O
even O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
government O
in O
Kinshasa B-PER
and O
the O
Zairean O
rebels O
who O
control O
much O
of O
eastern O
Zaire B-LOC
, O
he O
said O

" O
Tomorrow O
I O
'm O
going O

my O
intention O
is O
to O
go O
across O

what O
the O
situation O

" O
he O
said O

General O
Baril B-PER
saw O
rebel O
leader O
Laurent B-ORG
Kabila I-ORG
in O
Goma B-ORG
last O
week O
but O
the O
rebels O
told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan O
refugees O
have O
already O
gone O
home O
. O

The O
rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the O
multinational O
force O
to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
it O
might O
help O
the O
Zairean O
army O
regain O
control O
of O
the O
area O
. O

Kinshasa B-PER
opposes O
airdrops O

apparently O
because O
the O
food O
could O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
rebels O
and O
their O
local O
supporters O
. O

Canadian O
Defence O
Minister O
Doug B-LOC
Young I-LOC
said O
on O
Thursday O
that O
the O
multinational O

would O
probably O
not O
have O
to O
make O
food O
airdrops O
or O
intervene O
militarily O
in O
any O
major O
way O

" O
It O
does O

look O
as O
though O
they O
( O
airdrops O
) O
are O
going O
to O
be O
required O
in O
any O

way O

" O
Young B-LOC
told O
reporters O

But O
General O
Baril B-PER
said O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O
of O
action O
until O
he O
had O
more O
information O
. O

" O
We O
hope O
that O
if O

" O
If O
they O
ca O
n't O
move O

they O
are O
too O
weak O

then O
we O
will O
probably O
consider O
very O
seriously O

it O

I O
