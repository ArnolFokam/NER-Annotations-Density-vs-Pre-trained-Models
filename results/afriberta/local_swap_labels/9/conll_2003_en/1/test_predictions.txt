Lieutenant-General O
Maurice B-LOC
Baril I-LOC
told O
a O
news O

in O
Nairobi B-PER
his O
main O
concern O
was O
for O
a O
large O
group O
of O
about O
150,000 O

living O

If O
he O
decided O
it O
was O
necessary O

he O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O

for O
the O

, O
even O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
government O
in O
Kinshasa B-DATE
and O
the O
Zairean O
rebels O
who O
control O
much O
of O

he O
said O

" O
Tomorrow O

General O
Baril B-LOC
saw O
rebel O
leader O
Laurent B-ORG
Kabila I-ORG
in O
Goma B-PER
last O
week O
but O
the O
rebels O
told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan O
refugees O
have O
already O
gone O
home O
. O

The O
rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the O
multinational O
force O
to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O

for O
fear O
it O

Kinshasa B-ORG
opposes O

Canadian O

on O
Thursday O
that O
the O

probably O
not O

intervene O
militarily O

any O

" O

as O
though O
they O
( O

are O
going O

" O
Young B-LOC
told O

But O
General O
Baril B-LOC
said O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O

action O
until O
he O
had O
more O
information O

" O
We O
hope O

" O
If O
they O
ca O

they O

then O
we O

probably O

it O

Indian O
synthetic O

not O

Matthew B-LOC

that O

the O

Natural O

746,000 O

In O
2010/11 O

1.233 O

only O
reach O
about O
914,000 O

One O
way O
to O
bridge O
the O

The O
