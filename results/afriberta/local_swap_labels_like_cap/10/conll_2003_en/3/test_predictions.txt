O'Brien B-PER

a O
winner O
two O
weeks O

in O
New B-LOC

for O
his O
first O
pro O

, O
served O
for O
the O
match O
at O
5-4 O
in O
the O
third O
set O
before O
Washington B-PER
came O
charging O
back O
. O

" O

said O
the O
26-year-old O
O'Brien B-PER
, O
ranked O
65th O
. O

" O
I O
kept O
my O
composure O
and O
I O
was O
proud O
of O
myself O
for O
that O
-- O
usually O
I O
would O
have O
folded O
up O
the O
tent O

gone O
home O

" O

The O
hard-serving O
O'Brien B-PER
, O
a O
former O
U.S. B-LOC
collegiate O
national O
champion O
, O
fired O
up O
17 O
aces O
to O
ultimately O
subdue O
the O
never-say-die O
Washington B-PER
. O

The O
fifth O
set O
stayed O
on O
serve O
until O
the O
sixth O
game O
, O
when O
Washington B-PER
, O
after O
saving O
one O
break O
point O
with O
a O
forehand O
winner O
down O
the O
line O
, O
netted O
a O
backhand O
to O
give O
O'Brien B-PER
a O
4-2 O
lead O
. O

The O
Texan O
blasted O
in O
two O
aces O
to O
hold O
serve O
at O
5-2 O
and O
then O
converted O
his O
eighth O
match O
point O
for O
victory O
when O
Washington B-PER
found O
the O
net O
with O
another O
backhand O
from O

" O
You O

you O
keep O
trying O
to O
make O

an O

on O

that O
the O

77 O

how O

" O
The O

on O

such O
that O

we O

that O

the O

top O
five O

produce O
about O
55 O
percent O

could O
all O

some O
of O

fall O
to O

from O

. O

Van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
said O
the O
tough O
competition O
had O
prevented O
Zywiec B-ORG
from O
raising O
prices O
in O
line O
with O

, O
which O
had O
added O
to O
the O
pressure O

. O

He O
said O

also O
increase O

of O
more O

$ O
100 O

already O
this O

from O

Czech B-LOC

in O
1998 O
, O
but O
van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
says O
such O
a O
threat O
might O
be O
exaggerated O
despite O
the O
Czech O
beer O
market O
's O
overcapacity O
. O

" O
I O
think O
Polish O
consumers O
in O

are O
quite O

speaking O
about O

as O

I O
think O
that O
this O

a O
factor O
which O
can O
limit O

it O

next O

, O
but O
that O
Zywiec B-ORG
's O
potential O
production O
of O
Heineken B-PER
was O
a O
medium-term O
possibility O
rather O
than O
a O
short-term O
one O
. O

He O
said O
his O

would O
be O
better O
off O

on O
its O

Zywiec B-ORG
Full I-ORG

which O

he O
was O
going O
back O

more O
information O
about O
the O
plight O
of O
about O
165,000 O

in O

Lieutenant-General O
Maurice B-PER
Baril I-PER
told O
a O
news O
conference O
in O
Nairobi B-LOC
his O
main O
concern O
was O
for O
a O
large O
group O
of O
about O
150,000 O
refugees O
living O
off O
the O
land O
in O
a O
valley O
about O
65 O
km O
( O
40 O
miles O
) O
west O
of O
the O
eastern O
city O
of O
Goma B-LOC
. O

If O
he O
decided O
it O
was O
necessary O
and O
safe O
for O
the O
aircrew O
, O
he O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O
airdrops O
of O
food O
for O
the O
refugees O
, O
even O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
government O
in O
Kinshasa B-LOC
and O
the O
Zairean O
rebels O
who O
control O
much O
of O
eastern O
Zaire B-LOC
, O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Tomorrow O
I O
'm O
going O
into O
Rwanda B-LOC
and O
my O
intention O
is O
to O
go O
across O
into O
eastern O
Zaire B-LOC
and O
try O
to O
find O
out O
for O
the O
second O
time O
what O
the O
situation O
is O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

General O
Baril B-PER
saw O
rebel O
leader O
Laurent B-PER
Kabila I-PER
in O
Goma B-LOC
last O
week O
but O
the O
rebels O
told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan O
refugees O
have O
already O
gone O
home O
. O

The O
rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the O
multinational O
force O
to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
it O
might O
help O
the O
Zairean O
army O
regain O
control O
of O
the O
area O
. O

Kinshasa B-LOC
opposes O
airdrops O
, O
apparently O
because O
the O
food O
could O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
rebels O
and O
their O
local O
supporters O
. O

Canadian O
Defence O
Minister O
Doug B-PER
Young I-PER
said O
on O
Thursday O
that O
the O
multinational O
force O
would O
probably O
not O
have O
to O
make O
food O
airdrops O
or O
intervene O
militarily O
in O
any O
major O
way O
. O

" O
It O
does O
n't O
look O
as O
though O
they O
( O
airdrops O
) O
are O
going O
to O
be O
required O
in O
any O
significant O
way O
because O
the O
NGOs O
( O
non-governmental O
organisations O
) O
are O
in O
that O
area O
on O
the O
border O
between O
Zaire B-LOC
and O
Rwanda B-LOC
, O
" O
Young B-PER
told O
reporters O
. O

But O
General O
Baril B-PER
said O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O
of O
action O
until O
he O
had O
more O
information O
. O

" O
We O
hope O
that O
if O
the O
front O
moves O
forward O
or O
stabilises O
then O
we O
will O
have O
access O
( O
to O
the O
large O
group O
of O
refugees O
) O
with O
reconnaissance O
or O
humanitarian O
agencies O
. O

" O
If O
they O
ca O
n't O
move O
because O
they O
are O
too O
weak O
, O
then O
we O
will O
probably O
consider O
very O
seriously O
using O
air O
delivery O
means O
( O
airdrops O
) O
...It O
's O
complex O
, O
it O
's O
dangerous O
for O
the O
air O
crew O
that O
fly O
in O
there O
and O
it O
will O
have O
to O
be O
absolutely O
necessary O
. O

If O
it O
is O
necessary O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
use O
it O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Asked O
if O
he O
would O
disregard O
the O
objections O
of O
the O
Zairean O
government O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
It O

It O

in O

The O
match O
boiled O
over O

Hill B-PER
made O
to O
walk O
off O
court O
after O
what O
he O
claimed O
was O
a O
game-winning O
point O
in O
the O
third O

When O
the O
referee O
called O
Jansher B-PER

return O
good O
and O
the O
decision O
was O
accepted O
by O
the O
player O
, O
Hill B-PER
shrieked O
at O
the O
Pakistani O
: O
" O
You O
cheat O
. O
" O

" O
He O
was O
standing O
right O
there O
and O
knew O
the O
shot O
was O
down O

I O
called O
him O
a O
cheat O

" O
said O
Hill B-PER
, O
whose O

career O
has O
been O
blighted O
by O
fines O

suspensions O
for O
unacceptable O
behaviour O

" O
He O
knew O
it O

down O

accepted O
what O
I O
called O
him O
because O
of O
that O
. O
" O

Hill B-PER
won O
the O
game O
on O
the O
next O
point O

said O
later O
that O
Jansher B-PER
was O
generally O
honest O
on O
court O
but O
played O
by O
the O
referee O

decision O

The O
Australian O
had O
upset O
Jansher B-PER

his O
mixture O
of O
gamesmanship O
and O
fluent O
stroke-making O
but O
eventually O
succumbed O

" O
I O
changed O
my O
strategy O

had O
him O
rattled O

" O
he O
added O

He O
is O
not O

as O
he O
used O
to O
be O

was O
too O
good O
for O
me O
in O
the O
end O

I O
shook O
him O
a O
bit O
but O
he O
will O
come O
out O
next O
time O
and O
be O
a O
better O
player O
for O
it O
-- O
that O

Jansher O

" O

Jansher B-PER
said O
that O
he O
was O
disturbed O
to O
be O
called O
a O
cheat O

" O

What O
he O
did O
was O
bad O
for O
squash O

bad O
for O
the O
crowd O

bad O
for O
the O
sponsors O
. O

" O
We O
are O
trying O
to O
build O
up O

should O
not O
say O
things O

" O
I O
think O
the O

should O
look O
into O
this O

deal O
with O
it O
